abstract = {Tanzania's Ruaha landscape is an international priority area for large carnivores, supporting over 10{\%} of the world's lions and important populations of leopards and spotted hyaenas. However, lack of ecological data on large carnivore distribution and habitat use hinders the development of effective carnivore conservation strategies in this critical landscape. Therefore, the study aimed to (i) identify the most significant ecogeographical variables influencing the potential distribution of lions, leopards and spotted hyaenas across the Ruaha landscape; (ii) identify zones with highest suitability for harbouring those species; and (iii) use species distribution modelling algorithms (SDMs) to define important areas for conservation of large carnivores. Habitat suitability was calculated based on environmental features from georeferenced presence-only carnivore location data. Potential distribution of large carnivores appeared to be strongly influenced by water availability; highly suitable areas were situated close to rivers and experienced above average annual precipitation. Net primary productivity and tree cover also exerted some influence on habitat suitability. All three species showed relatively narrow niche breadth and low tolerance to changes in habitat characteristics. From 21,050 km2 assessed, 8.1{\%} (1,702 km2) emerged as highly suitable for all three large carnivores collectively. Of that area, 95.4{\%} (1,624 km2) was located within 30 km of the Park-village border, raising concerns about human-carnivore conflict. This was of particular concern for spotted hyaenas, as they were located significantly closer to the Park boundary than lions and leopards. This study provides the first map of potential carnivore distribution across the globally important Ruaha landscape, and demonstrates that SDMs can be effective for understanding large carnivore habitat requirements in poorly sampled areas. This approach could have relevance for many other important wildlife areas that only have limited, haphazard presence-only data, but which urgently require strategic conservation planning.},

abstract = {Seasonal fluctuations in water availability cause predictable changes in the profitability of habitats in tropical ecosystems, and animals evolve adaptive behavioural and spatial responses to these fluctuations. However, stochastic changes in the distribution and abundance of surface water between years can alter resource availability at a landscape scale, causing shifts in animal behaviour. In the Okavango Delta, Botswana, a flood-pulsed ecosystem, the volume of water entering the system doubled between 2008 and 2009, creating a sudden change in the landscape. We used African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) to test the hypotheses that seasonal habitat selection would be related to water availability, that increased floodwater levels would decrease forage abundance and affect habitat selection, and that this would decrease buffalo resting time, reduce reproductive success and decrease body condition. Buffalo selected contrasting seasonal habitats, using habitats far from permanent water during the rainy season and seasonally-flooded habitats close to permanent water during the early and late flood seasons. The 2009 water increase reduced forage availability in seasonally-flooded habitats, removing a resource buffer used by the buffalo during the late flood season, when resources were most limited. In response, buffalo used drier habitats in 2009, although there was no significant change in the time spent moving or resting, or daily distance moved. While their reproductive success decreased in 2009, body condition increased. A protracted period of high water levels could prove detrimental to herbivores, especially to smaller-bodied species that require high quality forage. Stochastic annual fluctuations in water levels, predicted to increase as a result of anthropogenically-induced climate change, are likely to have substantial impacts on the functioning of water-driven tropical ecosystems, affecting environmental conditions within protected areas. Buffer zones around critical seasonal resources are essential to allow animals to engage in compensatory behavioural and spatial mechanisms in response to changing environmental conditions.},

abstract = {Wildlife management policies are often based on expert perceptions of the ecological importance of certain species and poorly informed perceptions of how public attitudes toward management are formed. Little is known about why preferences vary greatly and how this affects support for management actions. This paper explores preferences for a range of wildlife species among a sample of the rural population adjacent to Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. We also examine the degree of acceptance for alternative management interventions when potentially dangerous animals pose different levels of problems to human beings, and the extent to which these attitudes are related to species preferences. Gender has a significant effect on species preferences. Men like most species better than women. Age has no significant effect, but level of education affects preference level for some species. Species preferences have a positive effect on support for management intervention when dangerous animals cause small or moderate problems to humans, i.e. there is a higher degree of acceptance of problems caused by animals that are well liked. In situations where human life is threatened, species preferences have no effect on preferred management actions. Appreciation of animals is a combination of functional, consumptive and cultural dimensions, and there is no simple link between species preferences and attitudes toward management actions. The local context and concrete experience with wildlife encounters is more important for shaping normative beliefs like attitudes towards management actions than global wildlife attitudes.},

We argue that while Maasai do come into conflict with lions, their relationship with the large cats is far more complex and includes positive dimensions.

abstract = {Lion (Panthera leo) populations are in decline throughout most of Africa. The problem is particularly acute in southern Kenya, where Maasai pastoralists have been spearing and poisoning lions at a rate that will ensure near term local extinction. We investigated 2 approaches for improving local tolerance of lions: compensation payments for livestock lost to predators and Lion Guardians, which draws on local cultural values and knowledge to mitigate livestock-carnivore conflict and monitor carnivores. To gauge the overall influence of conservation intervention, we combined both programs into a single conservation treatment variable. Using 8 years of lion killing data, we applied Manski's partial identification approach with bounded assumptions to investigate the effect of conservation treatment on lion killing in 4 contiguous areas. In 3 of the areas, conservation treatment was positively associated with a reduction in lion killing. We then applied a generalized linear model to assess the relative efficacy of the 2 interventions. The model estimated that compensation resulted in an 87-91{\%} drop in the number of lions killed, whereas Lion Guardians (operating in combination with compensation and alone) resulted in a 99{\%} drop in lion killing.

The report deals with the actual assessment of crop damage by wildlife, including elephant, the crops grown by these farmers, information on the wild animals killed by villagers and the relevant authorities in the areas and the application of non lethal methods to effect crop protection. Both of the main food crops maize and sorghum were the two crops most often damaged by elephant, and they were destroyed not only during the ripening stages as they seem to be in most places but here they were raided from the time they appeared as seedling to maturity. Both bulls and mixed herds raided crops and raiding occured during both the wet and dry season. Farmers are not vigilant in protecting their crops and much needs to be done in this area. Thunder flashes and flares and other active protection should be encouraged, but elephant do get habituated to some of tactics so care must be taken to use them effectively. People should be discouraged from individual scattered fields and encouraged to plant communally. Unless active crop protection is put in place raiding will continue, animals will continue to be shot in the name of crop protection and conservation programmes difficult to put in place and maintain. Elephant and human related deaths and injures were not recorded for village areas, but were available for districts for 1975-1995: in Rufiji District 1685 elephant were killed and 693 were injured in crop protection shooting, while 21 people were killed and 14 were injured by elephant; in Kilwa District respectives figures were 2047 and 370, and 22 and 16.},

Within-subjects pre–post t-tests showed a significant increase in acceptance among those in the benefits and combined treatments. A between-subjects 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a significant difference between the perceived control and combined treatments (where the perceived control message actually decreased acceptance). Our results highlight the importance of including information about benefits stemming from the presence of black bears, as adding this information tended to increase stakeholder acceptance of black bear populations.},

abstract = {1. Over the last three decades the main prey species (wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus, zebra Equus burchelli, Thomson's gazelle Gazella thomsoni, and Grant's gazelle Gazella granti) of spotted hyaenas Crocuta crocuta in the Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania, substantially declined in numbers, whereas buffalo Syncerus caffer numbers increased strongly. This provided a ‘natural experiment' to investigate how a generalist predator such as the spotted hyaena responds to long-term changes in prey populations. Here we compare data on the feeding ecology of Crater hyaenas from the late 1990s (period II) with equivalent data from the late 1960s ( period I). 2. Hyaenas showed strong hunting preferences for wildebeest calves and gazelle fawns during both periods I and II. Adult buffaloes, prey difficult to hunt for hyaenas, were rarely hunted in either period despite a large increase in buffalo numbers from period I to II. 3. Hyaenas exhibited a functional response to the changes in prey populations by killing more buffalo calves and adult wildebeest during period II, relatively easy prey categories for hyaenas to hunt. 4. The proportion of carcasses scavenged and acquired by kleptoparasitizing other predators increased from period I to II. This was facilitated by an increase in the relative number of lion kills available to hyaenas during the same period. 5. Hyaenas defended a similar proportion of their kills against kleptoparasitic attempts by lions during both periods. Since the ratio of kills hyaenas kleptoparasitized from lions in relation to kills lost to lions increased from period I to period II, hyaenas obtained more food resources from lions during period II than I. 6. The success of hyaenas kleptoparasitizing lions was influenced by the presence of male lions and the ability of hyaenas to recruit sufficient clan members to appropriate carcasses from lions. 7. This study is the first to demonstrate both a functional response of a predator to changes in the size of prey populations and an associated change in foraging behaviour of the predator.},

Removing the thorns$\backslash$nfrom three of the species affected these parameters differently,$\backslash$naccording to the size and density of thorns.$\backslash$n3. Animals took larger bites from larger patches (branches), and bite$\backslash$nmass declined as patch exploitation progressed, implying that animals$\backslash$nwere selecting the larger items to eat first.

This model guides research of human behavior in these situations and yields information that can aid conflict pre- vention and mitigation on the local level and offer suggestions for effective coordinated global, national, or regional efforts. Past applications of the micro (individual level) component and preliminary research and potential areas of future exploration for the macro (cultural level) component are dis- cussed. Cross-cultural research will be highly useful in advancing an under- standing of human–wildlife conflict.},

abstract = {This study examines the population biology of African buffalo (Syncerus caffer Sparrman) at Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (HiP), South Africa. An analysis of buffalo census data covering the period from 1956 to 2006 shows that the population has a moderate intrinsic growth rate at around 12{\%} per annum, which is similar to growth rates of buffalo populations measured elsewhere. The population is subject to density dependence when the number of buffalo in the park exceeds approximately 3500 animals. In most years over the past 25 years, the population has exceeded this threshold, and net annual population growth has averaged around 5{\%}. Periods of buffalo population decline always coincided with heavy buffalo removals, suggesting limited resilience of the population to such disturbances. Demographic data from 826 buffalo in 12 herds, captured in 2001-2002, were used to parameterize an age-structured buffalo population model. The model yields an annual population growth rate of 4.05{\%}, similar to recent growth estimates from buffalo censuses at HiP. The predicted stable age distribution is very similar to the age distribution observed in the captured population sample. Elasticity analysis of the model indicates that population growth in buffalo is most sensitive to adult and juvenile survival, and less sensitive to recruitment parameters and survival of old animals. Buffalo populations might therefore be expected to be more vulnerable to mortality factors affecting prime-aged adults than those affecting juveniles or senescent individuals.},

abstract = {Corridors are critical elements in the long-term conservation of wide-ranging species like the jaguar (Panthera onca). Jaguar corridors across the range of the species were initially identified using a GIS-based least-cost corridor model. However, due to inherent errors in remotely sensed data and model uncertainties, these corridors warrant field verification before conservation efforts can begin. We developed a novel corridor assessment protocol based on interview data and site occupancy modeling. We divided our pilot study area, in southeastern Nicaragua, into 71, 6. ×. 6 km sampling units and conducted 160 structured interviews with local residents. Interviews were designed to collect data on jaguar and seven prey species so that detection/non-detection matrices could be constructed for each sampling unit. Jaguars were reportedly detected in 57{\%} of the sampling units and had a detection probability of 28{\%}. With the exception of white-lipped peccary, prey species were reportedly detected in 82-100{\%} of the sampling units. Though the use of interview data may violate some assumptions of the occupancy modeling approach for determining 'proportion of area occupied', we countered these shortcomings through study design and interpreting the occupancy parameter, psi, as 'probability of habitat used'. Probability of habitat use was modeled for each target species using single state or multistate models. A combination of the estimated probabilities of habitat use for jaguar and prey was selected to identify the final jaguar corridor. This protocol provides an efficient field methodology for identifying corridors for easily-identifiable species, across large study areas comprised of unprotected, private lands. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Studies assessing the potential for large predators to affect, via trophic cascades, the dynamics of riparian plant communities and the morphology of river channels have been largely absent in the scientific literature. Herein, we consider the results of recent studies involving three national parks in the western United States: Yellowstone, Olympic, and Zion. Within each park, key large predators were extirpated or displaced in the early 1900s and subsequent browsing pressure by native ungulates initiated long-term declines in recruitment (i.e., growth of seedlings/sprouts into tall saplings and trees) of palatable woody species and impairment of other resources. Channel responses to browsing-suppressed riparian vegetation included increased widths of active channels via accelerated bank erosion, erosion of floodplains and erraces, increased area of unvegetated alluvium, channel incision, and increased braiding. A reduced frequency of overbank flows indicated these rivers have become increasingly disconnected from historical floodplains because of channel widening/incision. Results from Zion National Park also identified major biodiversity affects (e.g., reduced abundance of plant and animal species). Although these studies were conducted in national parks, results may have implications concerning riparian plant communities, biodiversity, and channel morphology for streams and rivers draining other public lands in the western US. It is on these lands that native and introduced ungulates have often heavily utilized riparian areas, largely in the absence of key predators, with significant consequences to plant communities and channels. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Effective management of biological resources is contingent upon stakeholder compliance with rules. With respect to disease management, partial compliance can undermine attempts to control diseases within human and wildlife populations. Estimating non-compliance is notoriously problematic as rule-breakers may be disinclined to admit to transgressions. However, reliable estimates of rule-breaking are critical to policy design. The European badger (Meles meles) is considered an important vector in the transmission and maintenance of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in cattle herds. Land managers in high bTB prevalence areas of the UK can cull badgers under license. However, badgers are also known to be killed illegally. The extent of illegal badger killing is currently unknown. Herein we report on the application of three innovative techniques (Randomized Response Technique (RRT); projective questioning (PQ); brief implicit association test (BIAT)) for investigating illegal badger killing by livestock farmers across Wales. RRT estimated that 10.4{\%} of farmers killed badgers in the 12 months preceding the study. Projective questioning responses and implicit associations relate to farmers' badger killing behavior reported via RRT. Studies evaluating the efficacy of mammal vector culling and vaccination programs should incorporate estimates of non-compliance. Mitigating the conflict concerning badgers as a vector of bTB requires cross-disciplinary scientific research, departure from deep-rooted positions, and the political will to implement evidence-based management.},

abstract = {Two parallel lines of inquiry, tolerance for and acceptance of wildlife populations, have arisen in the applied literature on wildlife conservation to assess probability of successfully establishing or increasing populations of controversial species. Neither of these lines is well grounded in social science theory, and diverse measures have been employed to assess tolerance, which inhibits comparability across studies. We empirically tested behavioral measures of tolerance against self-reports of previous policy-relevant behavior and behavioral intentions. Both composite behavioral measures were strongly correlated (r {\textgreater} .70) with two attitudinal measures of tolerance commonly employed in the literature. The strong correlation between attitudinal and behavioral measures suggests existing attitudinal measures represent valid, parsimonious measures of tolerance that may be useful when behavioral measures are too cumbersome or misreporting of behavior is anticipated. Our results demonstrate how behavioral measures of tolerance provide additional, useful information beyond general attitudinal measures.},

abstract = {This paper discusses a new model for the diffusion of information through heterogeneous social networks. In earlier models, when information was given by one actor to another the transmitter did not retain the information. The new model is an improvement on earlier ones because it allows a transmitter of information to retain that information after telling it to somebody else. Consequently, the new model allows more actors to have information during the information diffusion process. The model provides predictions of diffusion times in a given network at the global, dyadic, and individual levels. This leads to straight forward generalizations of network measures, such as closeness centrality and betweenness centrality, for research problems that focus on the efficiency of information transfer in a network. We analyze in detail how information diffusion rimes and centrality measures depend an a series of network measures, such as degrees and bridges. One important finding is that predictions about the time actors need to spread information in the network differ considerably between the new and old models, while the predictions about the time needed to I receive information hardly differ. Finally, some cautionary remarks are made about using the model in empirical research.},

In this paper, we propose two natural special cases of the ICM such that a good estimate of this quantity can be efficiently computed. Using real large-scale social networks, we experimentally demonstrate that for extracting influential nodes, the proposed models can provide novel ranking methods that are different from the ICM, typical methods of social network analysis, and PageRank method. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate that when the propagation probabilities through links are small, they can give good approximations to the ICM for finding sets of influential nodes.},

The spontaneous formation of trends provides a well documented mechanism for the spread of information across a population, the creation of culture and the self-regulation of social behavior. Here I introduce an agent based dynamical model that captures the essence of trend formation and collapse. The resulting population dynamics alternates states of great diversity (large configurational entropy) with the dominance by a few trends. This behavior displays a kind of self-organized criticality, measurable through cumulants analogous to those used to study percolation. I also analyze the robustness of trend dynamics subject to external influences, such as population growth or contraction and in the presence of explicit information biases. The resulting population response gives insights about the fragility of public opinion in specific circumstances and suggests how it may be driven to produce social consensus or dissonance.},

We explore the influence of wildlife crop-damage on attitudes to the adjacent game reserve. Data on the frequency of crop-damage events and estimated severity of impacts, recorded during a 6-month programme of crop-damage monitoring in one of the survey villages, are used to describe on-farm patterns of crop-damage. Comparison of the two data sets indicates a disjunction between the nature of the wildlife crop-damage conflict as perceived by local villagers, and as it actually occurs in the study area. This disjunction is discussed in relation to the effect of extreme damage events on local people's views, the opportunity costs involved in guarding farm plots against crop-damage, and the tenure arrangements for wildlife that define the relationship with the state wildlife management authority.},

From the data, coefficients for the intrinsic growth rate of both lions and wildebeest are estimated, as well as the predator efficiency to convert food into fertility. We modify this model by considering three possible lion cropping strategies: cropping at a constant rate, cropping proportional to the population present, and cropping proportional to the square of the population present. By doing so, we see dramatic changes in the nature of the critical points of the model and obtain interesting interpretations of centers, repelling spiral points and attracting spiral points. While we do include the mathematical theory for our models, we concentrate on model interpretation, which students generally find-more difficult than performing the calculations. Our discussion is elementary and suitable for students in a second semester course in elementary differential equations or in a first course in ecology or wildlife management},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of Bayesian hierarchical spatial models has become widespread in disease mapping and ecologic studies of health-environment associations. In this type of study, the data are typically aggregated over an extensive time period, thus neglecting the time dimension. The output of purely spatial disease mapping studies is therefore the average spatial pattern of risk over the period analyzed, but the results do not inform about, for example, whether a high average risk was sustained over time or changed over time. OBJECTIVE: We investigated how including the time dimension in disease-mapping models strengthens the epidemiologic interpretation of the overall pattern of risk. METHODS: We discuss a class of Bayesian hierarchical models that simultaneously characterize and estimate the stable spatial and temporal patterns as well as departures from these stable components. We show how useful rules for classifying areas as stable can be constructed based on the posterior distribution of the space-time interactions. We carry out a simulation study to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of the decision rules we propose, and we illustrate our approach in a case study of congenital anomalies in England. RESULTS: Our results confirm that extending hierarchical disease-mapping models to models that simultaneously consider space and time leads to a number of benefits in terms of interpretation and potential for detection of localized excesses.},

abstract = {Snakebites are environmental and occupational health hazards that mainly affect rural populations worldwide. The ectothermic nature of snakes raises the issue of how climate change's impact on snake ecology could influence the incidence of snakebites in humans in ways that echo the increased predation pressure of snakes on their prey. We thus ask whether snakebites reported in Costa Rica from 2005 to 2013 were associated with meteorological fluctuations. We emphasize El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a climatic phenomenon associated with cycles of other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in the region and elsewhere. We ask how spatial heterogeneity in snake-bites and poverty are associated, given the importance of the latter for NTDs. We found that periodicity in snakebites reflects snake reproductive phenology and is associated with ENSO. Snakebites are more likely to occur at high tem-peratures and may be significantly reduced after the rainy season. Nevertheless, snakebites cluster in Costa Rican areas with the heaviest rainfall, increase with poverty indicators, and decrease with altitude. Altogether, our results suggest that snakebites might vary as a result of climate change.},

Explicit examples of how a model is being developed, improved and tested are rare in literature. This is probably because of the many uncertainties, shortcomings in data, assumptions, speculations and intuitive decisions that form part of the process, which provokes a deep and well-founded fear of the resulting model being criticized. We investigate the effects of including or excluding various phenomena present in population interactions in order to mimic a real world situation. This allows for gaining insight into the behaviour of the system and possible projections of future trends that can be expected.

abstract = {This paper examines crop damage by mammals and the farmers' experiences of crop losses around Gashaka village on the south-western border of Gashaka Gumti National Park, Nigeria. Data were collected via a weekly count of damaged maize crops in 23 fields in the wet season and 30 in the dry season. We examined: (i) seasonal frequency and extent of damage, (ii) losses experienced relative to expected gains, and (iii) aspects of fields in relation to their susceptibility to raiding. Cows caused the greatest amount of damage during the year. Tantalus monkeys were the wild species that caused the most damage. The experience of individual farmers varied from no damage to complete loss of an entire season's crop. Currently the only apparent certainty in predicting losses for farmers was that those farmers with fields closer to wildlife refuges are more likely to experience greater losses. The importance of domestic animal crop damage should not be underestimated in its impact on farmers' livelihoods. Management of crop-raiding in general requires an integrated approach taking domestic animals into account. Pro-active guarding is suggested as having potential to reduce crop losses in Gashaka.},

abstract = {Although carnivores are in global decline, diverse carnivore communities are common in sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 20 species may co-occur. Though intraguild competition and predation can limit the set of species that coexist, most carnivores have traits that decrease the impacts of interspecific competition on fitness, a pattern that promotes coexistence. An increasing human population and demand for natural resources (e.g. farming) has fragmented landscapes, reduced available prey, and elevated rates of conflict. These anthropogenic pressures tend to eliminate large carnivores first, which can have cascading effects on ecosystem function (e.g. mesopredator release). Anthropogenic pressures might also affect mesocarnivores directly, but this hypothesis has received little research attention to date. Here, we used camera surveys to describe spatial and temporal patterns of carnivore occupancy in a mixed-use landscape in Kenya. This landscape included a community conservation area and seasonally occupied human settlement and livestock grazing areas. We detected 21 carnivore species and examined occupancy patterns for the 12 most frequently detected. Differences among species in responses to environmental conditions supported a hypothesis of spatial niche partitioning. Differences in the temporal activity patterns of the apex predators and mesocarnivores supported a hypothesis of temporal niche partitioning. Human land use altered occupancy patterns in 10 of 12 species. Apex predator occupancies were lower in more anthropogenically disturbed areas, but mesocarnivore occupancies were not inversely related to apex predators, contrary to the mesopredator release hypothesis. Our results suggest that a diverse carnivore community persists in this mixed use landscape because of seasonal variation in human land use. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Collectively, thesemodels offer tremendous flexibility, but simultaneously place added demands on the investigator. 3. Unlike many mark–recapture scenarios, investigators utilizing occupancy models have the ability, and responsibility, to define their sample units (i.e. sites), replicate sampling occasions, time period overwhich species occurrence is assumed to be static and even the criteria that constitute ‘detection' of a target species. Subsequent biological inference and interpretation of model parameters depend on these definitions and the ability to meet model assumptions. 4. Wedemonstrate the relevance of these definitions by highlighting applications from a single biological system (an amphibian–pathogen system) and discuss situations where the use of occupancy models has been criticized. Finally,we use these applications to suggest future research andmodel development.},

abstract = {Conflict between people and wildlife is a major issue in both wildlife conservation and rural development. In African rangelands, species such as African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus), cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), lions (Panthera leo), leopards (Panthera pardus), and spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) may kill livestock and are therefore themselves killed by local pastoralists. Such conflict has led to the extirpation of these species from many areas, and also impacts the livelihoods of local livestock farmers. To investigate the possibilities for coexistence of people, livestock, and large predators in community rangelands, we measured the effectiveness of traditional livestock husbandry in reducing depredation by wild carnivores, using a case-control approach. Different measures were effective against different predator species but, overall, the risk of predator attack by day was lowest for small herds, accompanied by herd dogs as well as human herders, grazing in open habitat. By night, the risk of attack was lowest for herds held in enclosures ('bomas') with dense walls, pierced by few gates, where both men and domestic dogs were present. Unexpectedly, the presence of scarecrows increased the risks of attack on bomas. Our findings suggest that improvements to livestock husbandry can contribute to the conservation and recovery of large carnivores in community rangelands, although other measures such as prey conservation and control of domestic dog diseases are also likely to be necessary for some species.},

abstract = {Theoretical ecology is largely founded on the principle of mass action, in which uncoordinated populations of predators and prey move in a random and well-mixed fashion across a featureless landscape. The conceptual core of this body of theory is the functional response, predicting the rate of prey consumption by individual predators as a function of predator and/or prey densities. This assumption is seriously violated in many ecosystems in which predators and/or prey form social groups. Here we develop a new set of group-dependent functional responses to consider the ecological implications of sociality and apply the model to the Serengeti ecosystem. All of the prey species typically captured by Serengeti lions (Panthera leo) are gregarious, exhibiting nonlinear relationships between prey-group density and population density. The observed patterns of group formation profoundly reduce food intake rates below the levels expected under random mixing, having as strong an impact on intake rates as the seasonal migratory behaviour of the herbivores. A dynamical system model parameterized for the Serengeti ecosystem (using wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) as a well-studied example) shows that grouping strongly stabilizes interactions between lions and wildebeest. Our results suggest that social groups rather than individuals are the basic building blocks around which predator-prey interactions should be modelled and that group formation may provide the underlying stability of many ecosystems.},

abstract = {This study was designed to investigate the relative effects of seed perishability and handling time on the caching preferences of grey squirrels, Sciurus carolinensis, and to test the predictions for caching behavior that follow from these 2 hypotheses. Free-ranging squirrels were presented with acorns from 2 oak subgenera, Erythrobalanus and Leucobalanus, that vary in perishability (due to germination schedules) and handling time (due to acorn size). In 6 separate caching experiments, individual squirrels were sequentially presented with 2 acorn types, so that each paired treatment varied in handling time and/or perishability. Caching responses were recorded for each acorn, along with eating and caching times. Squirrels consistently consumed acorns of high perishability and cached acorns of low perishability, without regard to handling time. This result suggests that the perishability of seeds exerts a greater influence than handling time on the grey squirrel's decision to cache acorns.},

Via computer simulation, we found that the model provides good estimates of the occupancy rates, generally unbiased for moderate detection probabilities (?0.3).We estimated site occupancy rates for two anuran species at 32 wetland sites in Maryland, USA, from data collected during 2000 as part of an amphibian monitoring program, Frog- watch USA. Site occupancy rates were estimated as 0.49 for American toads (Bufo amer- icanus), a 44{\%} increase over the proportion of sites at which they were actually observed, and as 0.85 for spring peepers (Pseudacris crucifer), slightly above the observed proportion of 0.83.},

abstract = {African lion (Panthera leo) populations are in decline throughout most of Africa, but the problem is particularly acute in southern Kenya, where Maasai people are spearing and poisoning lions at a rate that will ensure near term local extinction. Lion killing is shaped by Maasai perception of livestock depredation, socio-economic factors, and the complex relationship between Maasai and conservation. These all affect tolerance for lions and consequently Maasai behavior towards conservation initiatives and carnivores in general. We used an in-depth quantitative questionnaire and participatory rural appraisals (PRAs) to identify the social and ecological predictors of lion killing and to investigate the effect of a compensation scheme on individual tolerance. Individuals who lose a greater proportion of their livestock to predators relative to their overall livestock loss, those affiliated with an evangelical church, and those who mainly sell rather than accumulate livestock all reported a higher propensity to kill carnivores. The future of carnivore conservation in this region depends on a better understanding of the nuances of human-carnivore conflict and a concerted effort to address appropriate cultural and community-level institutions, chiefly by providing economic benefits to local people who engage in positive conservation activities. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In South Africa, wild dogs are limited to a single viable population in Kruger National Park. Current conservation efforts aim to develop a meta-population through the reintroduction of wild dogs into fenced reserves. However, significant potential also exists for conserving naturally occurring wild dogs in situ on ranchland. This study represents an assessment of the attitudes of southern African landowners towards wild dogs to determine the scope for conserving them on private land, and to identify the conditions under which conservation efforts might succeed. Over half of ranchers interviewed indicated that they would like to have wild dogs on their property. Younger ranchers were more positive than older ranchers, suggesting that traditional prejudices against wild dogs are fading. Attitudes were generally negative where ranches are game-fenced, and where cattle or consumptive wildlife utilisation dominate land use. Negative attitudes were typically related to economic costs associated with wild dogs, and conservation initiatives aimed at reducing costs or creating benefits from the species represent the most direct way to improve attitudes. Many ranchers recognised the potential ecotourism value of wild dogs, and attitudes were most positive where ranches belong to conservancies, and where ecotourism-based land uses predominate. Similar relationships were found between ranch/rancher characteristics and attitudes towards most large carnivores. Thus, our findings have general relevance for large carnivore conservation on private land in southern Africa. Encouraging the formation of conservancies should be a priority for carnivore conservation efforts on ranchland, to reduce conflict and promote coexistence between people and predators. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Facilitating human-carnivore coexistence is a major conservation concern in human-dominated landscapes worldwide. Useful insights could be gained by studying and understanding the dynamics of human-carnivore coexistence in landscapes in which carnivores and humans have coexisted for a long time. We used a two-pronged approach combin- ing ecological and social data to study coexistence of showed that bears and humans coexisted relatively peacefully despite occasional conflicts. Coexistence appeared to be facilitated by: (1) the availability of large forest blocks that are connected to the source population of bears in the Carpathian Mountains; (2) the use of traditional livestock management to min- imize damage from bears; and (3) some tolerance among shepherds to occasional conflict with bears. In contrast, bear activity was unrelated to human settle- ments, and compensation for livestock losses did not influence people's attitudes toward bears. Our study shows that coexistence of humans and carnivores is possible, even without direct economic incentives. A key challenge for settings with a discontinuous history of human-carnivore coexistence is to reinstate both practices and attitudes that facilitate coexistence.},

abstract = {The manner in which terrestrial ecosystems are regulated is controversial. The "top-down" school holds that predators limit herbivores and thereby prevent them from overexploiting vegetation. "Bottom-up" proponents stress the role of plant chemical defenses in limiting plant depredation by herbivores. A set of predator-free islands created by a hydroelectric impoundment in Venezuela allows a test of these competing world views. Limited area restricts the fauna of small (0.25 to 0.9 hectare) islands to predators of invertebrates (birds, lizards, anurans, and spiders), seed predators (rodents), and herbivores (howler monkeys, iguanas, and leaf-cutter ants). Predators of vertebrates are absent, and densities of rodents, howler monkeys, iguanas, and leaf-cutter ants are 10 to 100 times greater than on the nearby mainland, suggesting that predators normally limit their populations. The densities of seedlings and saplings of canopy trees are severely reduced on herbivore-affected islands, providing evidence of a trophic cascade unleashed in the absence of top-down regulation.},

abstract = {Balancing ecological and social outcomes of conservation actions is recognized in global conservation policy but is challenging in practice. Compensation to land owners or users for foregone assets has been proposed by economists as an efficient way to mitigate negative social impacts of human displacement from protected areas. Joint empirical assessments of the conservation and social impacts of protected area establishment involving compensation payments are scarce. We synthesized social and biological studies related to the establishment of the Derema forest corridor in Tanzania's biodiverse East Usambara Mountains. This lengthy conservation process involved the appropriation of approximately 960 ha of native canopy agroforest and steep slopes for the corridor and monetary compensation to more than 1100 claimants in the surrounding villages. The overarching goals from the outset were to conserve ecological processes while doing no harm to the local communities. We evaluated whether these goals were achieved by analyzing 3 indicators of success: enhancement of forest connectivity, improvement of forest condition, and mitigation of negative impacts on local people's livelihoods. Indicators of forest connectivity and conditions were enhanced through reductions of forest loss and exotic species and increases in native species and canopy closure. Despite great efforts by national and international organizations, the intervention failed to mitigate livelihood losses especially among the poorest people. The Derema case illustrates the challenges of designing and implementing compensation schemes for conservation-related displacement of people.

abstract = {1. Among large mammalian herbivores, juvenile survival tends to vary widely and may thus have a greater influence on population dynamics than the relatively constant survival rates typical of adults. However, previous studies yielding stage-specific survival rates have been mostly on temperate zone ungulates and in environments lacking large predators. 2. Annual censuses coupled with assessments of population structure enabled annual survival rates to be estimated for the juvenile, yearling and adult segments of nine ungulate species in South Africa's Kruger National Park. Four of these populations persisted at high abundance after initial increases (zebra, wildebeest, impala and giraffe), while five showed progressive declines during the latter part of the study period (kudu, waterbuck, warthog, sable antelope and tsessebe). 3. The magnitude of the reduction in adult survival between periods showing contrasting population trends was similar to or greater than the corresponding change in juvenile survival for five of the nine species. Accordingly alterations in population phase, from increasing to stable or stable to declining, were brought about mostly through reduced survival within the adult segment. Elevated predation risk may have been responsible. 4. Estimates were derived of the relative survival rates of juveniles, yearlings and adult segments associated with zero population growth, and the survival differential between adult males and females, for all nine species. Stage-specific survival rates appeared dependent on body mass, but with some anomalies. The sex difference in adult survival showed no obvious relation with sexual size dimorphism. 5. For large mammalian herbivores, assessments of relative elasticities of stage-specific survival rates on population growth are problematic for several reasons. Sensitivity to corresponding increments in either survival or mortality rates provides a better basis for ecological or adaptive interpretation. Survival rates of adults seem to vary more over multiyear periods compared with mainly annual fluctuations in juvenile survival. More studies are needed on tropical species and in environments retaining large predators to support generalizations about factors influencing ungulate life-history patterns.},

Neighbours had a significant negative effect on female reproductive success and survival, and larger prides were significantly more likely to maintain control of disputed areas and to improve the quality of their territories. Adult females were significantly less likely to be alone when a pride had more neighbours, suggesting sensitivity to risk of encounter. In most cases, the effects of intergroup territorial competition were associated only with prides that had not recently split (i.e. that were not closely related). Overall, males were more important in group-territorial competition than expected, and female mortality and wounding rates were significantly associated with male neighbours, suggesting that males may use lethal aggression to tip the balance of power in favour of their prides. Within the Felidae, only lions are consistently gregarious, and our research illustrates that numerical advantage in territorial competition is a primary benefit of group living in lions and may have been important in the evolution of lion sociality. ?? 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Private Protected Areas (PPAs) often use wildlife-based ecotourism as their primary means of generating business. Achieving tourist satisfaction has become a strong driving goal in the management of many PPAs, often at the expense of biodiversity. Many extralimitral species, those which historically did not occur in an area, are stocked in PPAs with the intention of increasing ecotourism attractions. Even though the ecological and economic costs of stocking these species are high, the social benefits are not understood and little information exists globally on the ecotourism role of extralimital species. This study assessed the value of stocking extralimital species using questionnaire-based surveys and observing tourists in Shamwari Private Game Reserve in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. No difference was found between indigenous and extralimital species with regards to the tourists' weighted scoring system, average amount tourists were willing to pay, total viewing time, average viewing time or the likelihood of stopping to view species when encountered on game drives. During game drives a strong preference was found for the elephant (Loxodonta africana), lion (Panthera leo), leopard (Panthera pardus) and cheetah (Acynonix jubatus). With the exception of the cheetah, these species are all members of the "big five" and are indigenous. Species availability and visibility, however, may influence the amount of time tourists spend at an animal sighting. Our analysis suggests that certain extralimital species (typically larger and charismatic species) contribute to tourist satisfaction, while particularly the smaller extralimital species add little to the game viewing experience, but add to the costs and risks of the PPAs. We recommend that extralimital species introductions for ecotourism purposes should be approached with caution with regards to the risks to the sustainability of PPAs.},

abstract = {Human activities affect large carnivores worldwide by increasing mortality due to destruction and fragmentation of habitats, decrease of prey availability, and hunting pressure. The jaguar (Panthera onca) is a large carnivore strongly influenced by these threats, with poaching of predators being primarily a retaliatory response that is motivated by depredation of domestic animals. We investigate the distribution of jaguars and cattle depredation in 21 sampling units located in Central Brazil. We consider native and domestic prey availability as well as land-scape configuration and composition as possible contributory factors. We removed correlated variables and conducted a set of logistic regressions in a step-wise approach. We used the difference between $\chi$2 of the newest and the previous model to evaluate if the addition of a variable increased the explanatory power of the newest model. Jaguar occurrence was influenced by prey richness, which is correlated with habitat aggregation in the landscape, revealing the attributes that can act as proxies for environmental quality for jaguar. The relationship between jaguar and prey richness also suggests that jaguar can act as a surrogate for the presence of other species. Jaguar occurrence is also related to the availability of non-native prey such as cattle, but not cattle depredation, suggesting that cattle depredation could be an op-portunistic event. Patterns of cattle depredation warrant further study because human-wildlife conflict is one of the greatest threats to jaguar conservation.},

@article{Vanak2013,
abstract = {Most ecosystems have multiple predator species that not only compete for shared prey, but also pose direct threats to each other. These intraguild interactions are key drivers of carnivore community structure, with ecosystem-wide cascading effects. Yet, behavioral mechanisms for coexistence of multiple carnivore species remain poorly understood. The challenges of studying large, free-ranging carnivores have resulted in mainly coarse-scale examination of behavioral strategies without information about all interacting competitors. We overcame some of these challenges by examining the concurrent fine-scale movement decisions of almost all individuals of four large mammalian carnivore species in a closed terrestrial system. We found that the intensity ofintraguild interactions did not follow a simple hierarchical allometric pattern, because spatial and behavioral tactics of subordinate species changed with threat and resource levels across seasons. Lions (Panthera leo) were generally unrestricted and anchored themselves in areas rich in not only their principal prey, but also, during periods of resource limitation (dry season), rich in the main prey for other carnivores. Because of this, the greatest cost (potential intraguild predation) for subordinate carnivores was spatially coupled with the highest potential benefit of resource acquisition (prey-rich areas), especially in the dry season. Leopard (P. pardus) and cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) overlapped with the home range of lions but minimized their risk using fine-scaled avoidance behaviors and restricted resource acquisition tactics. The cost of intraguild competition was most apparent for cheetahs, especially during the wet season, as areas with energetically rewarding large prey (wildebeest) were avoided when they overlapped highly with the activity areas of lions. Contrary to expectation, the smallest species (African wild dog, Lycaon pictus) did not avoid only lions, but also used multiple tactics to minimize encountering all other competitors. Intraguild competition thus forced wild dogs into areas with the lowest resource availability year round. Coexistence of multiple carnivore species has typically been explained by dietary niche separation, but our multi-scaled movement results suggest that differences in resource acquisition may instead be a consequence of avoiding intraguild competition. We generate a more realistic representation of hierarchical behavioral interactions that may ultimately drive spatially explicit trophic structures of multi-predator communities.},

However, population size is a poor predictor of extinction in large carnivores inhabiting protected areas.

The species most likely to disappear from small reserves are those that range widely-and are therefore most exposed to threats on reserve borders-irrespective of population size.

abstract = {Participation by local communities in management is widely considered a means of sustaining protected areas. In parts of the world with a history of armed conflict, the chances of such an approach being suc- cessfully adopted might seem remote. One such area is the Maputo Elephant Reserve in southern Mozambique. The aim was to improve understanding of the local people's use of natural resources and per- ceptions of the Reserve's impact. Interviews and questionnaires distributed in four different villages were used to estimate the relative value of these re- sources in relation to the attitude of the local people towards the Reserve. The people gave a relative value rank for each specific use of each plant, animal and fish resource. On average 60{\%} of the households ex- ploited more than two different resource categories. The plant resources of the Reserve were used by 71{\%} of the households and were valued more highly than animal and fish resources. Plants were used for many purposes; construction material, fuelwood and fruits had the highest relative values. Antelopes, hippopota- mus and elephants were valued highest amongst a range of animal species which were hunted by 21{\%} of households. Amongst uses of animals, consumption, use of the skins and commercial sale of the meat were especially important. When asked if they liked the Reserve, 88{\%} of respondents answered positively. The attitude towards the Reserve was correlated with crop damage experiences; people with crop damage caused by elephants, hippos or bushpigs, were more negative. Attitude of respondents was inversely related to the number of species invading their agricultural fields. Resource use intensity, use purpose, resource value and attitude were different amongst sites and dependent on site-specific circumstances, different management strategies could be necessary for the four sites. A resource management plan should be drawn up, local people should be included in the manage- ment team and steps should be taken to improve the relationship between the Reserve's authorities and the local population generally.},

abstract = {Human-wildlife conflict, particularly human-carnivore conflict, is a growing problem in today's crowded world, and can have significant impacts on both human and wildlife populations. This study, based in the Idodi-Pawaga area adjacent to Tanzania's Ruaha National Park, explored the main drivers of conflict between people and wildlife, particularly five focal large carnivore species, in order to identify possible mitigation strategies. Considerable antagonism towards wildlife was reported, with particular hostility engendered by large carnivores. The main reasons given for conflict were the risks of wildlife damage, particularly livestock depredation, and attacks upon humans. Initial reports suggested that people were losing 1.2{\%} of their livestock to predators every month, but after long-term monitoring this estimate was revised to 0.32{\%}, and on-site follow-up visits led to a further revised figure of 0.26{\%}, which was far less than the percentage reportedly lost to disease. Adherence to traditional livestock husbandry techniques seemed effective at limiting depredation, but follow-up surveys revealed that views towards focal carnivores remained robust even after many months without an attack. These data suggest that conflict is driven by numerous factors, rather than the risk of wildlife damage alone. Traditional pastoralists appeared less tolerant than other ethnic groups, with their history of land alienation for conservation, political marginalisation and insecurity over land tenure probably driving some of their antagonism towards wildlife. Income diversification was linked to higher tolerance, but few people received any income or non-consumptive benefits from wildlife. Conversion to an external religion, rather than retaining traditional beliefs, was also linked to a decrease in tolerance for wildlife. Overall, many different factors appeared to influence the magnitude of reported conflict, and it was clear that any mitigation efforts would have to confront the social, political, historical, economic and ecological drivers of conflict in order to develop truly appropriate and effective solutions.},

abstract = {This report covers the proceedings of the First Tanzanian Wild Dog Workshop held in February 2005. The workshop brought together a group of key stakeholders to assess existing information and establish a consensus on priorities for research and conservation for African wild dogs Lycaon pictus in Tanzania. Tanzania holds an estimated one third of the world's remaining wild dogs, more wild dogs than any other country. In addition, the biggest surviving single population survives in Tanzania's Selous Game Reserve. All participants to the workshop were deeply proud of Tanzania's international status for wild dog conservation, however they agreed that there is an urgent need to obtain better information on the distribution of wild dogs across the country, as well as more detailed data within specific regions. Wild dogs were known to occur to the east and south of the Serengeti, west Kilimanjaro and Longido, Manyara ranch, Tarangire and much of the Maasai steppe, Ugalla, Katavi, the Ruaha/Rugwa ecosystem, Rukwa/Lukwati, south east of Sumbawanga, Selous Game Reserve and Mikumi. However there was currently not a single region in the country with a good up to date estimate of wild dog population size and trends, and hence establishing minimal information for different regions was a key priority. Data needed could be broken down into distribution, population trends, density, demographic parameters such as survival and reproduction and ranging patterns. Different areas were thought to require data of different quality depending on what data already exists and likely threats. The group went through all methods currently available and summarized the type of data each method could generate, whilst also noting that not all methods would work in all areas. Only radio collaring generated data for all possible data needs. However other potentially worthwhile techniques included photo surveys using photographs from tourists, which can generate good information but is unlikely to be applicable in most areas because of a lack of visitors, and the use of working dogs, to locate wild dog scat, which shows much potential but is currently untested in Africa. The group also discussed potential threats and agreed that persecution, habitat loss/change and disease were the three most important factors affecting wild dog conservation in Tanzania.However, there was a paucity of information on the impacts of any of these threats. The techniques suitable for gathering information on wild dog distribution and status discussed earlier were found to be also useful for collecting information about threats. For example a questionnaire survey could potentially provide information on persecution and land use change, and even on some easily recognizable diseases such as rabies, whilst spoor surveys, working dogs and camera traps can provide information on the other predators (and prey) in the ecosystem. Radio collaring, because it involves handling, has the potential to provide good information on many diseases if a blood sample is collected, and because it is easier to monitor individuals if they are collared, information on deaths due to disease, persecution, snaring, road kills and even interspecific competition. Managers need information on the status and threats to wild dogs in their areas to plan management activities and to enable wild dog conservation, as well as assessing the impact of these activities on wild dog conservation. All participants wished to improve the standards of information on wild dogs across the country and their hard work in this workshop and report reflects this wish, and will hopefully provide wild dog research and conservation with a new impetus to address the identified priorities hand in hand with training and capacity building.},

@article{Tambling2005,
abstract = {Summary * 1Predation upon ungulates is generally considered to have a stronger regulatory effect on sedentary than migratory populations, with migratory populations maintaining higher densities. The blue wildebeest Connochaetus taurinus is a migratory species that has suffered a general decline in numbers and distribution across its species range. Wildebeest suffer from a fragmented distribution together with isolation of populations in closed reserves, preventing migratory movements and potentially allowing predators to benefit from a ‘captive' prey resource. * 2In Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa, the declining blue wildebeest population (from 1074 in 1995 to 594 in 2001) is sedentary because the park (50 000 ha) is completely enclosed by fencing. This population was used to model the potential effects of predation and harvesting. The Pilanesberg population was then compared with other wildebeest populations in southern Africa. * 3The model outputs demonstrated that increased levels of predation by lions Panthera leo on a ‘captive' population of prey such as wildebeest, in combination with regular harvesting by park managers, can drive the population towards extinction. At lower levels of predation some other factor needs to act in combination with predation to drive the population into a decline. * 4During our study the lion biomass density in Pilanesberg was almost three times greater than that predicted by regression models of the stable relationship between lion and prey biomass densities across African savannas. Furthermore, the ratio of lion numbers to prey numbers was substantially higher than in most other African reserves. * 5Synthesis and applications. In African savannas, artificial closed systems provide advantages to large predators. If wildlife-cropping schemes are implemented in such systems without careful monitoring and regulation of large predators, then ungulate populations can decline more rapidly than managers expect.},

The role of living organisms has been accounted for, but the focus has traditionally been on contributions of plants and microbes. We develop the case that fully “animating” the carbon cycle requires broader consideration of the functional role of animals in mediating biogeochemical processes and quantification of their effects on carbon storage and exchange among terrestrial and aquatic reservoirs and the atmosphere. To encourage more hypothesis-driven experimental research that quantifies animal effects we discuss the mechanisms by which animals may affect carbon exchanges and storage within and among ecosystems and the atmosphere. We illustrate how those mechanisms lead to multiplier effects whose magnitudes may rival those of more traditional carbon storage and exchange rate estimates currently used in the carbon budget. Many animal species are already directly managed. Thus improved quantitative understanding of their influence on carbon budgets may create opportunity for management and policy to identify and implement new options for mitigating CO2 release at regional scales.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interviews are among the most familiar strategies for collecting qualitative data. The different qualitative interviewing strategies in common use emerged from diverse disciplinary perspectives resulting in a wide variation among interviewing approaches. Unlike the highly structured survey interviews and questionnaires used in epidemiology and most health services research, we examine less structured interview strategies in which the person interviewed is more a participant in meaning making than a conduit from which information is retrieved. PURPOSE: In this article we briefly review the more common qualitative interview methods and then focus on the widely used individual face-to-face in-depth interview, which seeks to foster learning about individual experiences and perspectives on a given set of issues. We discuss methods for conducting in-depth interviews and consider relevant ethical issues with particular regard to the rights and protection of the participants.},

A series of factors that influence farmers' perceptions of risk are examined to help explain why perceived risk of crop loss to wildlife is often significantly greater than any actual risk. This is explored in the context of (1) changing tolerance for wildlife activity on farms, (2) the implications of past conserva- tion policy and practice for farmers' understanding of “ownership” of wild- life, and (3) how such issues influence farmers' expectations of who is responsible for protecting crops from wildlife.},

abstract = {Preventing and mitigating human-wildlife conflicts are a top conservation priority, particularly in India where wildlife and high densities of people co-occur. We surveyed 1972 households from 1371 villages in a 7449-km2 area surrounding five reserves in the Western Ghats. Our observational study modeled self-reported crop and livestock loss and compensation access by households. Crop loss was reported by 64{\%} of households and associated with growing cotton, sugarcane, coffee and rice. Livestock loss was reported by 15{\%} of households, and associated with grazing animals inside reserves. Losses incurred by households varied across reserves, averaging INR Rs 23,010 for crop loss and Rs 5423 for livestock loss. Compensation receipt was reported by 31{\%} of households, and associated with reporting loss to authorities and elephant related incidents. Overall, landscape estimated probability of crop loss was 0.91, livestock loss was 0.19 and compensation was 0.29. Common mitigation measures for crop protection were night watching (46{\%}), fencing (34{\%}) and scare devices (34{\%}); and for livestock protection were closer watch on animals (7{\%}), guard animals (3{\%}) and fencing (2{\%}). Among 13 reported mitigation measures, no individual measure appeared to be associated with lowering crop or livestock loss. Unexpectedly, reported losses were similar across all reserves with higher losses incurred by households closer to the reserves. We identified conflict hot spots and influential factors across five reserves to improve current management efforts directed at conflict prevention and mitigation, and this approach is extendable to other human-dominated wildlife rich landscapes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Lions (Panthera leo) are in decline throughout most of their range due to human persecution, largely provoked by depredation on livestock, and there is debate as to the usefulness of financial instruments to mitigate this conflict. Intending to reduce local lion-killing, the Mbirikani Predator Compensation Fund compensates members of Mbirikani Group Ranch for livestock depredation at a flat rate (close to average market value), after the kill has been verified and with penalties imposed for poor husbandry. Despite penalizing claimants, 55{\%} of claims arose because livestock were lost in the bush. Between 1st April 2003 and 31st December 2006, 754 cattle, 80 donkeys and 1844 sheep/goats were killed (2.31{\%} of the total livestock herd each year). Forty-three percent of kills were ascribed to spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta); leopards (Panthera pardus) and cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) were blamed for 37{\%} of cases, lions 7{\%}, jackals (Canis mesomelas) 7{\%} and buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and elephants (Loxodonta africana) together 6{\%}. Significantly more attacks took place during months of lower rainfall but the rate of attacks was not related to the density of livestock on the ranch, or the ratio of wild herbivores to domestic stock. There was no correlation between local market prices and the number of claims per month. Despite compensation, at least one lion per year was killed in 2004, 2005 and 2006. We describe some features of large carnivore depredation in the study area and suggest that regional recovery of the lion population may require compensation on a wider scale. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {There is a lack of consensus among conservationists as to whether trophy hunting represents a legitimate conservation tool in Africa. Hunting advocates stress that trophy hunting can create incentives for conservation where ecotourism is not possible. We assessed the hunting preferences of hunting clients who have hunted or plan to hunt in Africa (n=150), and the perception among African hunting operators (n=127) of client preferences at two US hunting conventions to determine whether this assertion is justified. Clients are most interested in hunting in well-known East and southern African hunting destinations, but some trophy species attract hunters to remote and unstable countries that might not otherwise derive revenues from hunting. Clients are willing to hunt in areas lacking high densities of wildlife or attractive scenery, and where people and livestock occur, stressing the potential for trophy hunting to generate revenues where ecotourism may not be viable. Hunting clients are more averse to hunting under conditions whereby conservation objectives are compromised than operators realize, suggest- ing that client preferences could potentially drive positive change in the hunting industry, to the benefit of conservation. However, the preferences and attitudes of some clients likely form the basis of some of the problems currently associated with the hunting industry in Africa, stressing the need for an effective regulatory framework.

abstract = {How herbivore behaviour is influenced by changes in resource levels is central for understanding trophic interactions. We examined whether foraging tradeoffs change with food levels by comparing habitat selection and space use within and between two neighbouring, predator-free Svalbard reindeer populations. The populations faced different food levels due to contrasting grazing history. Summer resource selection in radiocollared females was assessed by a multi-dimensional niche approach based on habitat variables obtained from a satellite image (e.g. the normalised difference vegetation index, NDVI) and a digital terrain model. The population at the overgrazed Broggerhalvoya faced overall lower plant cover, biomass and primary productivity (i.e. lower NDVI) than the population at Sarsoyra. At Broggerhalvoya, most reindeer selected for productive habitat when choosing home range and patches within the home range. In contrast, habitat selection at Sarsoyra was more affected by abiotic conditions such as moisture, which may influence plant quality. Here, reindeer used patches with even less biomass than the average reindeer at the poorer Broggerhalvoya. Such a difference in habitat preference with different habitat availability (a functional response in habitat selection) probably reflected increased selection for high-quality forage at the expense of high forage quantity at Sarsoyra. Accordingly, a negative relationship between habitat productivity and home range size was only present across individuals within Broggerhalvoya, where forage quantity was the important foraging niche component. Individuals having poor (and large) home ranges apparently could not compensate for this by higher patch selectivity compared to individuals with richer home ranges. The results indicate changes in foraging tradeoffs at contrasting resource levels and that strong interactions occur between habitat selection, space use and the foraging niche structure in the absence of predation.},

The key findings indicate that in order to increase public transport usage, the service should be designed in a way that accommodates the levels of service required by customers and by doing so, attract potential users. Furthermore, the choice of transport is influenced by several factors, such as individual characteristics and lifestyle, the type of journey, the perceived service performance of each transport mode and situational variables. This suggests the need for segmentation taking into account travel attitudes and behaviours. Policies which aim to influence car usage should be targeted at the market segments that are most motivated to change and willing to reduce frequency of car use. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Resource-selection probabiiity functions and occupancy models are powerful methods of identifying areas within a iandscape that are highly used by a species. One common design/analysis method for estimation of a resource-selection probability function is to classify a sample of units as used or unused and estimate the probability of use as a function of independent variabies using, for example, logistic regression. This method requires that resource units are correctly classified as unused (i.e., the species is never undetected in a used unit), or that the probability of misciassification is the same for all units. In this paper, t explore these issues, illustrating how misciassifying units as unused may lead to incorrect conclusions about resource use. t also show how recently developed occupancy models can be utilized within the resource-selection context to improve conclusions by explicitly accounting for detection probability. These models require that multiple sun/eys be conducted at each ofa sample of resource units within a relatively short timeframe, but given the growing evidence from simulation studies and field data, I recommend that such procedures should be incorporated into studies of resource use.},

abstract = {The faddishness of the business community is often noted and lamented but not well understood by standard models of innovation and diffusion. We combine arguments about organizational cognition and institutional mimicry to develop a model of adaptive emulation, where firms respond to perceived failure by imitating their most successful peers. Computational experiments show that this process generates empirically plausible cascades of adoption, even if innovations are entirely worthless. Faddish cycles are most robust across alternative treatments of managerial decision making where innovations have modest positive effects on outcomes. These results have broad implications for the faddishness of a business community increasingly marked by media-driven accounts of success, and for the properties of organizational practices that are hot one day and cold the next.},

abstract = {The origin of large but rare cascades that are triggered by small initial shocks is a phenomenon that manifests itself as diversely as cultural fads, collective action, the diffusion of norms and innovations, and cascading failures in infrastructure and organizational networks. This paper presents a possible explanation of this phenomenon in terms of a sparse, random network of interacting agents whose decisions are determined by the actions of their neighbors according to a simple threshold rule. Two regimes are identified in which the network is susceptible to very large cascades-herein called global cascades-that occur very rarely. When cascade propagation is limited by the connectivity of the network, a power law distribution of cascade sizes is observed, analogous to the cluster size distribution in standard percolation theory and avalanches in self-organized criticality. But when the network is highly connected, cascade propagation is limited instead by the local stability of the nodes themselves, and the size distribution of cascades is bimodal, implying a more extreme kind of instability that is correspondingly harder to anticipate. In the first regime, where the distribution of network neighbors is highly skewed, it is found that the most connected nodes are far more likely than average nodes to trigger cascades, but not in the second regime. Finally, it is shown that heterogeneity plays an ambiguous role in determining a system's stability: increasingly heterogeneous thresholds make the system more vulnerable to global cascades; but an increasingly heterogeneous degree distribution makes it less vulnerable.},

abstract = {Widespread interest in the diffusion of information through social networks has produced a large number of Social Dynamics models. A majority of them use theoretical hypothesis to explain their diffusion mechanisms while the few empirically based ones average out their measures over many messages of different contents. Our empirical research tracking the step-by-step email propagation of an invariable viral marketing message delves into the content impact and has discovered new and striking features. The topology and dynamics of the propagation cascades display patterns not inherited from the email networks carrying the message. Their disconnected, low transitivity, tree-like cascades present positive correlation between their nodes probability to forward the message and the average number of neighbors they target and show increased participants' involvement as the propagation paths length grows. Such patterns not described before, nor replicated by any of the existing models of information diffusion, can be explained if participants make their pass-along decisions based uniquely on local knowledge of their network neighbors affinity with the message content. We prove the plausibility of such mechanism through a stylized, agent-based model that replicates the Affinity Paths observed in real information diffusion cascades. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Variation in the spatial arrangement of plant tissue modifies the functional response of herbivores. In heterogeneous environments, this variation can occur at multiple spatial scales. We used likelihood-based approaches to examine the strength of evidence in data for models of herbivore functional response to spatial variation in plants. These models represented different hypotheses about plant characteristics controlling intake rate, including biomass, bite mass, plant density, and the composite effects of plant density and bite mass. Models were fit to observations of the food intake rate of elk (Cervus canadensis), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus), domestic rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), and lemmings (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus) feeding in plant patches where plant density and plant mass ranged over at least two orders of magnitude. The model representing composite effects of bite mass and plant density had more support in the data than any competing models (Akaike weight for the composite model ? 0.999). Maximum-likelihood estimates of parameters in the composite model closely resembled independent, direct estimates, giving credence to the mechanisms represented by the model. The composite model portrayed a distance threshold (d*, in meters) distinguishing mech- anisms regulating functional response. When plant spacing exceeded this threshold, intake rate was regulated by plant density. When the plant spacing was less than the threshold, intake rate was controlled by bite mass. Based on earlier work, we show that the threshold d* scales with body mass (M, in kilograms) as 7.1M0.06 . This relationship illustrates that: (1) spatial pattern of plants at patch scales may influence intake rate only when plants occur at very low density; (2) herbivores of very different body mass respond to heterogeneity in a remarkably similar fashion; and (3) variation in leaf-scale characteristics controlling bite mass interact with plant spacing at patch scales to influence herbivore functional response.},

In north-central Namibia, farmers believed that leopard (Panthera pardus) densities were growing on farmland areas adjacent to Waterberg Plateau Park and that the Park was a source population for leop- ards venturing beyond park boundaries during the night to feed on the livestock in the farmlands (Stein, 2008). Leopard densities elsewhere have been correlated with ungulate abundance (Stander et al., 1997; Marker {\&} Dickman, 2005), but our camera surveys (Stein, Fuller {\&} Marker, 2008) indicated that leopard prey was more abundant outside of versus inside the Park. Thus, we pre- dicted that leopard density was higher outside of the Park and thus not a population ‘sink' for leopards. To test this hypothesis, we estimated leopard density for both areas via capture–mark–recapture techniques using camera-trap- ping (e.g., Karanth {\&} Nichols, 1998; Henschel {\&} Ray, 2003; Silver et al., 2004; Jackson et al., 2006) combined with home range sizes estimated from telemetry data.},

Six Brahman cattle were fed on three different diets in a replicated Latin square experiment over three periods. The diets were (1) long-chopped Angleton grass (Dicanthium aristatum) hay ad libitum (DM digestibility (DMD) 41 (SE 2){\%}; 4 g N/kg), (2) long-chopped Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) hay ad libitum (DMD 60 (SE 1){\%}; 14 g N/kg) or (3) 2 kg long-chopped lucerne (Medicago sativa) hay/d plus a high-grain diet (ad libitum) (DMD 70 (SE 1){\%}; 31 g N/kg). CH4 production was measured using confinement-type respiration chambers. Metabolizable energy intake (MJ/d) of cattle fed on Angleton grass (18.4 (SE 2.0)) was lower (P {\textless} 0.01) than that for Rhodes grass (54.9 (SE 2.1)), which was lower (P {\textless}0.01) than that for the high-grain diet (76.7 (SE 5.8)). CH4 production (g/d) for cattle fed on Rhodes grass (257 (SE 14)) was higher (P {\textless} 0.01) than that for cattle fed on both the high-grain diet (160 (SE 24)) and Angleton grass (113 (SE 16)). CH4 conversion rate (MJ CH4 produced per 100 MJ gross energy intake) was not significantly different between cattle fed on Angleton (10.4 (SE 1.1)) and Rhodes (11.4 (SE 0.3)) grass, but was higher (P {\textless} 0.01) than for cattle fed on the high-grain diet (6.7 (SE 0.7)). CH4 production (g/kg live-weight gain) was associated (P {\textless} 0.001) with both live-weight gain and feed:gain ratio. We conclude that the relationships between CH4 production, energy utilization and live-weight change of cattle fed on tropical forages differ from those of cattle fed on diets based on temperate forages.},

abstract = {The killing of a satellite-tagged male lion by a trophy hunter in Zimbabwe in July 2015 provoked an unprecedented media reaction. We analyse the global media response to the trophy hunting of the lion, nicknamed “Cecil”, a study animal in a long-term project run by Oxford University's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit (WildCRU). We collaborated with a media-monitoring company to investigate the development of the media coverage spatially and temporally. Relevant articles were identified using a Boolean search for the terms Cecil AND lion in 127 languages. Stories about Cecil the Lion in the editorial media increased from approximately 15 per day to nearly 12,000 at its peak, and mentions of Cecil the Lion in social media reached 87,533 at its peak. We found that, while there were clear regional differences in the level of media saturation of the Cecil story, the patterns of the development of the coverage of this story were remarkably similar across the globe, and that there was no evidence of a lag between the social media and the editorial media. Further, all the main social media platforms appeared to react in synchrony. This story appears to have spread synchronously across media channels and geographically across the globe over the span of about two days. For lion conservation in particular, and perhaps for wildlife conservation more generally, we speculate that the atmosphere may have been changed significantly. We consider the possible reasons why this incident provoked a reaction unprecedented in the conservation sector.},

abstract = {* Like many wildlife populations across Africa, recent analyses indicate that African lions are declining rapidly outside of small fenced areas. Community conservancies – privately protected areas that engage community members in conservation – may potentially maintain wildlife populations in unfenced pastoralist regions, but their effectiveness in conserving large carnivores has been largely unknown until now. * We identify drivers of lion survival in community conservancies within the Masai Mara ecosystem, Kenya, applying mark–recapture analyses to continuous sight–resight surveys. We use the number of livestock and human settlements as proxies for potential human–lion conflict whilst controlling for environmental variables and lion socioecology. * Average lion densities within the Mara conservancies between 2008 and 2013 (11{\textperiodcentered}87 lions 100 km−2) were 2{\textperiodcentered}6 times higher than those previously reported in 2003. Survival rates varied amongst prides and were highest for lions utilizing central regions of conservancies. * The number of livestock settlements (bomas [corrals] and manyattas) that were not members of a conservancy, and that fell within a pride home-range, had a large negative effect on female survival and was the most influential external predictor in models. These non-conservancy settlements accounted for 37{\textperiodcentered}2{\%} of total observed variation in survival, whereas conservancy settlements, which benefit financially from wildlife through their membership, had no effect on lion survival. * Internal drivers of survival agreed with known ecology and social behaviour including age plus a negative effect of male takeovers on cub survival {\textless}6 months. Vegetation cover, prey availability and the density of grazing livestock within a pride's range did not explain patterns in lion survival. * Synthesis and applications. We show that lion densities have increased substantially within the Mara conservancies over the last decade and suggest that the creation of community conservancies has benefitted their survival. This suggests that lions can survive outside of fenced areas within pastoral regions if communities gain benefits from wildlife. We highlight the importance of expanding existing conservancies beyond their current geographical and political scope and forming buffer zones if wildlife ranges outside them. We suggest that changing attitudes to predators should be a key goal of community-based conservancies. Further work is recommended to identify what specific aspects of conservancy membership promote lion survival.},

abstract = {The current extinction crisis is caused primarily by human impacts upon wild populations. Large carnivores are especially sensitive to human activity; because their requirements often conflict with those of local people, predators have been actively persecuted in most regions of the world. In this paper, the impact of people upon predators is analysed by relating local carnivore extinctions to past and projected human population densities. There are strong associations between high human density and the loss of carnivore populations from a region. Interspecific variation in ability to survive at high human densities probably reflects species' ability to adapt to human-modified habitats. However, regional and temporal variation in individual species' sensitivity to human density is more likely to reflect the activities of local people than the phenotypes of local carnivores. Local culture, government policy and international trade all influence human attitudes to predators and, therefore, the impact of people upon carnivore populations. The importance of these factors may mean that extinction risks for carnivores will continue to increase, even though human population growth is projected to deccelerate during the new millennium. This points to an urgent need for techniques to resolve conflicts between people and predators at either the local or landscape level.},

abstract = {Context. Lion (Panthera leo Linnaeus, 1758) populations experience a range of ecological and human influences that affect their demography. Few lion populations have reliable estimates of population size, trends in these, or demographic profiles. Threats such as those imposed by diseases are thus hard to evaluate and respond to. Aims. To calibrate call-up stations and define survey effort required to achieve estimates with known precision, and extract age structures and estimate survival rates, to estimate lion numbers, sex and age structure and survival rates, and then to evaluate the effect of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) on estimates of lion density and survival. Methods.By using call-up stations, we developed a statistically robust approach to estimate selected population variables and evaluated the perceived threat of bTB in landscapes of varying prey biomass in the Kruger National Park. Key results. The size of the lion population was stable, although long intervals between present and historical estimates limit this conclusion. Density and survival rates associated positively with prey biomass, and a positive association was detected between the survival rate and bTB prevalence, with survival being higher in areas that had high prevalence of bTB. Male survival was lower than female survival, disregarding the effects of prey biomass or bTB prevalence. Body condition of lions was high, with scores lower at low to medium prey density. Conclusions. The effect of an exotic disease on the Kruger lion population may be negligible at present. Intra-specific competition in areas where lions live at high densities affects survival rate. However, droughts could disrupt the hierarchical influences of prey biomass and bTB prevalence on lion densities and survival. Implications. To evaluate the effect of an exotic disease on lion demography, population surveys should include age- and sex-structure assessments, complemented with focal studies of fecundity. This reflects the importance of understanding host-disease dynamics to inform management options. {\textcopyright} CSIRO 2010.},

abstract = {Fixed kernel density analysis with least squares cross-validation (LSCVh) choice of the smoothing parameter is currently recommended for home-range estimation. However, LSCVh has several drawbacks, including high variability, a tendency to undersmooth data, and multiple local minima in the LSCVh function. An alternative to LSCVh is likelihood cross-validation (CVh). We used computer simulations to compare estimated home ranges using fixed kernel density with CVh and LSCVh to true underlying distributions. Likelihood cross-validation generally performed better than LSCVh, producing estimates with better fit and less variability and it was especially beneficial at sample sizes {\textless}similar to 50. Because CVh is based on minimizing the Kullback-Leibler distance and LSCVh the integrated squared error, for each of these measures of discrepancy, we discussed their foundation and general use, statistical properties as they relate to home-range analysis, and the biological or practical interpretation of these statistical properties. We found 2 important problems related to computation of kernel home-range estimates, including multiple minima in the LSCVh and CVh functions and discrepancies among estimates from current home-range software. Choosing an appropriate smoothing parameter is critical when using kernel methods to estimate animal home ranges, and our study provides useful guidelines when making this decision.},

abstract = {Spotted hyaenas Crocuta crocuta were once considered mere scavengers; however, detailed research revealed that they are very efficient predators. Information on what spotted hyaenas actually prefer to prey on and what they avoid is lacking, as well as the factors that influence prey selection. Data from 14 published and one unpublished study from six countries throughout the distribution of the spotted hyaena were used to determine which prey species were preferred and which were avoided using Jacobs' index. The mean of these values for each species was used as the dependent variable in multiple regression, with prey abundance and prey body mass as predictive variables. In stark contrast to the rest of Africa's large predator guild, spotted hyaenas do not preferentially prey on any species. Also surprisingly, only buffalo, giraffe and plains zebra are significantly avoided. Spotted hyaena most prefer prey within a body mass range of 56–182 kg, with a mode of 102 kg. The dietary niche breadth of the spotted hyaena is similar to that of the lion Pan- thera leo, and the two species have a 58.6{\%} actual prey species overlap and a 68.8{\%}preferred prey species overlap.These results highlight the flexible and unselec- tive nature of spotted hyaena predation and are probably a reason for the species' success throughout its range, despite a large degree of dietary overlap with lions.

abstract = {Mammalian top-predators can have positive, negative and negligible effects on economic, environmental and social values, which vary spatially and temporally. Harnessing 'pros' while mitigating 'cons' of top-predators remains a key management challenge, particularly outside reserves in agro-ecosystems. In this study, long-term (1972-2008) and broad-scale (250,000km2) datasets were used to explore co-relationships between rainfall, kangaroo abundance, beef-cattle calf production and dingo control effort in arid Australia. Best subsets and multiple regression analyses show that calf production fluctuates independently of dingo control, and kangaroo populations comprise 13-36{\%} (mean 26{\%}) of the combined kangaroo-cattle herd in any given year. Kangaroo abundance was associated most strongly with bottom-up forces (rainfall) as expected, but a combination of bottom-up (rainfall) and top-down (dingo control) processes best explained variation in kangaroo abundance trends. Supplementary economic analysis indicated that ongoing kangaroo competition with cattle is far more costly to beef producers than the occasional predation of calves by dingoes. These results suggest that lethal top-predator control practices in arid Australia may not be achieving their fundamental aim (to increase livestock production) because increased competition from native herbivores freed from top-predator suppression erodes the accrued economic benefits of a reduction in livestock predation. These data suggest that retaining top-predators outside reserves in agro-ecosystems may be advantageous to livestock producers and ecosystems where and/or when top-predators exert stronger effects on livestock competitors than they do on livestock. These data also highlight how increased knowledge of species interactions can reconcile competing wildlife management interests in agricultural food webs.},

abstract = {Coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) are systems of feedback linking people and ecosystems. A feature of CHANS is that this ecological feedback connects people across time and space. Failing to account for these dynamic links results in intertemporal and spatial externalities, reaping benefits in the present but imposing costs on future and distant people, such as occurs with overgrazing. Recent findings about locust-nutrient dynamics create new opportunities to address spatiodynamic ecosystem externalities and develop new sustainable strategies to understand and manage locust outbreaks. These findings in northeast China demonstrate that excessive livestock grazing promotes locust outbreaks in an unexpected way: by lowering plant nitrogen content due to soil degradation. We use these human-locust-livestock-nutrient interactions in grasslands to illustrate CHANS concepts. Such empirical discoveries provide opportunities to address externalities such as locust outbreaks, but society's ability to act may be limited by preexisting institutional arrangements. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Vertebrate herbivores and fire are known to be important drivers of vegetation dynamics in African savannas. It is of particular importance to understand how changes in herbivore population density, especially of elephants, and fire frequency will affect the amount of tree cover in savanna ecosystems, given the critical importance of tree cover for biodiversity, ecosystem function, and human welfare. We developed a spatially realistic simulation model of vegetation, fire, and dominant herbivore dynamics, tailored to the Serengeti ecosystem of east Africa. The model includes key processes such as tree-grass competition, fire, and resource-based density dependence and adaptive movement by herbivores. We used the model to project the ecosystem 100 years into the future from its present state under different fire, browsing (determined by elephant population density), and grazing (with and without wildebeest present) regimes. The model produced the following key results: (1) elephants and fire exert synergistic negative effects on woody cover; when grazers are excluded, the impact of fire and the strength of the elephant-fire interaction increase; (2) at present population densities of 0.15 elephants/km2, the total amount of woody cover is predicted to remain stable in the absence of fire, but the mature tree population is predicted to decline regardless of the fire regime; without grazers present to mitigate the effects of fire, the size structure of the tree population will become dominated by seedlings and mature trees; (3) spatial heterogeneity in tree cover varies unimodally with elephant population density; fire increases heterogeneity in the presence of grazers and decreases it in their absence; (4) the marked rainfall gradient in the Serengeti directly affects the pattern of tree cover in the absence of fire; with fire, the woody cover is determined by the grazing patterns of the migratory wildebeest, which are partly rainfall driven. Our results show that, in open migratory ecosystems such as the Serengeti, grazers can modulate the impact of fire and the strength of the interaction between fire and browsers by altering fuel loads and responding to the distribution of grass across the landscape, and thus exert strong effects on spatial patterns of tree cover.},

We find that TKs are not purely retaliatory in nature (i.e. a desire for retribution following livestock depredation or attacks on humans by tigers) and that previous negative experience of tigers is not the sole determinant of villagers' acceptance of TK behaviour. Inter-related social-psychological factors (risk perceptions, beliefs about tigers, tolerance for tigers), institutional failings (i.e. of the institutions villagers perceive to be responsible for resolving village tiger incidents), perceived personal rewards (financial rewards, enhanced social status, medicinal or protective value of tiger body parts), and contextual factors (the severity of a village tiger incident) motivate people to kill tigers when they enter villages and foster the widespread acceptance of this behaviour. Knowledge of these motivational factors can be used to develop conservation actions suitable for developing both communities' capacity and, crucially, desire to co-exist with tigers and to respond with non-lethal action to village tiger incidents.},

Our results indicate that predation risk may have profound effects on the structure of ecosystems and is an important constituent of native biodiversity.

Predicting depredation occurrence is difficult, yet necessary to prevent it. Better prediction of wolf depredation also would facilitate application of sound depredation management actions. In this paper we analyze temporal trends in wolf depredation occurrence and wolf control, which is employed as a depredation management action. We gathered data from wolf depredation investigations for Alberta, Canada, from 1982-1996 and for Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, USA, from 1987-2003. We showed that wolf attacks occurred with a seasonal pattern, reflecting the seasonality of livestock calving, grazing practices, and seasonal variation in energetic requirements of wolf packs. Seasonal wolf attacks were auto-correlated with lags of one year, indicating annual reoccurrence. Cross-correlation analyses indicated that limited wolf control was rapidly employed as a short-term response to depredation, and was not designed to decrease wolf depredation at a regional scale or in the long-term. We therefore discovered a reoccurring seasonal-annual pattern for wolf depredation and wolf control in western North America. Ranchers and managers could use our data for focusing investment of resources to prevent wolf depredation increases during high-depredation seasons.},

abstract = {We quantified livestock (cattle, shoats, horses and donkeys) losses to lions (Panthera leo) and attitudes to lions, livestock losses and tourism among livestock owners, village residents and tourism workers around Makgadikgadi Pans National Park in Botswana. Losses were not correlated with the size or structure of livestock enclosures, numbers of dogs or herders. Rather losses increased with the amount of livestock owned. Most were stray animals preyed upon at night. Attitudes to wildlife, conservation and lions were also not consistently distributed within the society we studied. Negative attitudes to lions were almost ubiquitous among cattleposts but less widespread among people living in the more urbanized society of villages or among people working in tourism. Although four tourist camps were operating in the area, benefits from these operations were largely limited to employees. Despite considerable sums of money being paid to Botswana by local tourist facilities few respondents viewed tourism as valuable and most felt that the government and not they or their community was the main beneficiary of tourism. Tourism employees made up a small sub-section of the adult population drawn predominately from larger villages while the costs of livestock losses were spread among cattleposts near the park boundary. These same cattlepost respondents were not prepared to improve stock care to protect livestock, but indicated a willingness to kill lions instead. If tourism is to play a role in reducing human-wildlife conflict, communities must not be regarded as homogenous entities into which to distribute benefits evenly. Benefits might usefully be distributed in relation to the costs of coexisting with wildlife or used as incentives to better protect livestock or other human resources. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Herein, we posit a link between the ecological extinction of wolves in the American West and the expansion in distribution, increased abundance, and inflated ecological influence of coyotes. We investigate the hypothesis that the release of this mesopredator from wolf suppression across much of the American West is affecting, via predation and competition, a wide range of faunal elements including mammals, birds, and reptiles. We document various cases of coyote predation on or killing of threatened and endangered species or species of conservation concern with the potential to alter community structure. The apparent long-term decline of leporids in the American West, for instance, might be linked to increased coyote predation. The coyote effects we discuss could be context dependent and may also be influenced by varying bottom-up factors in systems without wolves. We make recommendations for ecological research in light of ongoing wolf recovery in parts of the West. Strong ecological effects of wolf repatriation may not occur outside of large reserves where wolves are prevented from achieving ecologically effective densities because of wolf hunting or wolf control programs.

abstract = {Large predators potentially can help shape the structure and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, yet strong evidence of top-down herbivore limitation has not been widely reported in the scientific literature. Herein we synthesize outcomes of recent tri-trophic cascades studies involving the presence and absence of large predators for five national parks in the western United States, including Olympic, Yosemite, Yellowstone, Zion, and Wind Cave. Historical observations by park biologists regarding woody browse species and recently compiled age structure data for deciduous trees indicate major impacts to woody plant communities by ungulates following the extirpation or displacement of large predators. Declines in long-term tree recruitment indexed additional effects to plant communities and ecological processes, as well as shifts towards alternative ecosystem states. The magnitude and consistency of vegetation impacts found within these five parks, in conjunction with other recent North American studies, indicate that broad changes to ecosystem processes and the lower trophic level may have occurred in other parts of the western United States where large predators have been extirpated or displaced. Thus, where ungulates have significantly altered native plant communities in the absence of large predators, restoration of native flora is urgently needed to recover former ecosystem services. Following the reintroduction of previously extirpated gray wolves Canis lupus into Yellowstone National Park, a spatially patchy recovery of woody browse species (e.g., aspen Populus tremuloides, willow Salix spp., cottonwood Populus spp.) has begun, indicating that large predator recovery may represent an important restoration strategy for ecosystems degraded by wild ungulates. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Many wildlife species face imminent extinction because of human impacts, and therefore, a prevailing belief is that some wildlife species, particularly large carnivores and ungulates, cannot coexist with people at fine spatial scales (i.e., cannot regularly use the exact same point locations). This belief provides rationale for various conservation programs, such as resettling human commu- nities outside protected areas. However, quantitative information on the capacity and mechanisms for wildlife to coexist with humans at fine spatial scales is scarce. Such information is vital, because the world is becoming increasingly crowded. Here, we provide empir- ical information about the capacity and mechanisms for tigers (a globally endangered species) to coexist with humans at fine spatial scales inside and outside Nepal's Chitwan National Park, a flagship protected area for imperiled wildlife. Information obtained fromfield cameras in 2010 and 2011 indicated that human presence (i.e., people on foot and vehicles) was ubiquitous and abundant throughout the study site; however, tiger density was also high. Surprisingly, even at a fine spatial scale (i.e., camera locations), tigers spatially overlappedwith people on foot and vehicles in both years. However, in both years, tigers offset their temporal activity patterns to be much less active during the day when human activity peaked. In addition to temporal displacement, tiger–human coexistence was likely enhanced by abundant tiger prey and low levels of tiger poaching. Incorporating fine-scale spatial and temporal activity patterns into conservation plans can help address a major global challenge—meeting human needs while sustaining wildlife.},

abstract = {Mitigating crop and livestock loss to wildlife and improving compensation distribution are important for conservation efforts in landscapes where people and wildlife co-occur outside protected areas. The lack of rigorously collected spatial data poses a challenge to management efforts to minimize loss and mitigate conflicts. We surveyed 735 households from 347 villages in a 5154 km(2) area surrounding Kanha Tiger Reserve in India. We modeled self-reported household crop and livestock loss as a function of agricultural, demographic and environmental factors, and mitigation measures. We also modeled self-reported compensation received by households as a function of demographic factors, conflict type, reporting to authorities, and wildlife species involved. Seventy-three percent of households reported crop loss and 33{\%} livestock loss in the previous year, but less than 8{\%} reported human injury or death. Crop loss was associated with greater number of cropping months per year and proximity to the park. Livestock loss was associated with grazing animals inside the park and proximity to the park. Among mitigation measures only use of protective physical structures were associated with reduced livestock loss. Compensation distribution was more likely for tiger related incidents, and households reporting loss and located in the buffer. Average estimated probability of crop loss was 0.93 and livestock loss was 0.60 for surveyed households. Estimated crop and livestock loss and compensation distribution were higher for households located inside the buffer. Our approach modeled conflict data to aid managers in identifying potential conflict hotspots, influential factors, and spatially maps risk probability of crop and livestock loss. This approach could help focus allocation of conservation efforts and funds directed at conflict prevention and mitigation where high densities of people and wildlife co-occur.},

abstract = {African wild dogs are 20–25 kg social carnivores whose major prey are ungulates ranging from 15 to 200 kg. In the Selous Game Reserve, Tanzania, wild dog pack size ranged from three to 20 adults (3–44 including yearlings and pups). Data from 905 hunts and 404 kills showed that hunting success, prey mass and the probability of multiple kills increased with number of adults. Chase distance decreased with number of adults. None the less, the distribution of per capita food intake across adult pack size was U-shaped, with a minimum close to the modal pack size. A similar result has been used to conclude that cooperative hunting does not favour sociality in lions (Packer et al. 1990, Am. Nat., 136, 1–19), and to argue that cooperative hunting is not responsible for group living in any carnivore (Caro 1994, Cheetahs of the Serengeti Plains: Group Living in an Asocial Species). Daily per capita food intake only accounts for variation in the benefits to cooperative hunting, ignoring variation in costs. For Selous wild dogs, per capita food intake per km chased peaked close to the modal adult pack size (where per capita food intake per day was near its minimum). Thus, the energetics of cooperative hunting favour sociality in Selous wild dogs. Analyses that incorporate variation in both costs and benefits of hunting may show that cooperative hunting favours sociality in other species where its influence has previously been rejected.},

abstract = {1. The reintroduction of grey wolves Canis lupus (L.) to Yellowstone National Park provides a natural experiment in which to study the effects of a keystone predator on ecosystem function. 2. Grey wolves often provision scavengers with carrion by partially consuming their prey. 3. In order to examine how grey wolf foraging behaviour influences the availability of carrion to scavengers, we observed consumption of 57 wolf-killed elk Cervus elaphus (L.) and determined the percentage of edible biomass eaten by wolves from each carcass. 4. We found that the percentage of a carcass consumed by wolves increases as snow depth decreases and the ratio of wolf pack size to prey size and distance to the road increases. In addition, wolf packs of intermediate size provide the most carrion to scavengers. 5. Applying linear regression models to the years prior to reintroduction, we calculate carrion biomass availability had wolves been present, and contrast this to a previously published index of carrion availability. Our results demonstrate that wolves increase the time period over which carrion is available, and change the variability in scavenge from a late winter pulse dependent primarily on abiotic environmental conditions to one that is relatively constant across the winter and primarily dependent on wolf demographics. Wolves also decrease the year-to-year and month-to-month variation in carrion availability. 6. By transferring the availability of carrion from the highly productive late winter, to the less productive early winter and from highly productive years to less productive ones, wolves provide a temporal subsidy to scavengers.},

In analytical terms persistence means that liminft??????x(t){\textgreater} 0 for each population x(t); in geometric terms, that each trajectory of the modeling system of differential equations is eventually bounded away from the coordinate planes. The class of systems considered allows three level food webs, two competing predators feeding on a single prey, or a single predator feeding on two competing prey populations. As a corollary to the last case it is shown that the addition of a predator can lead to persistence of a three population system where, without a predator, the two competing populations on the lower trophic level would have only one survivor. The basic models are of Kolmogorov type, and the results improve several previous theorems on persistence. ?? 1984.},

abstract = {We combine data collected from the past 40 years to estimate the indirect effects of sea otters (Enhydra lutris) on ecosystem carbon (C) production and storage across their North American range, from Vancouver Island to the western edge of Alaska's Aleutian Islands. We find that sea otters, by suppressing sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus spp) populations, allow kelp (Order Laminariales) ecosystems to develop with a net primary productivity (NPP) of 313?900 grams C per square meter per year (g C m?2 yr?1) and biomass density of 101?180 grams C per square meter (g C m?2). In the absence of sea otters, these areas would have an NPP of 25?70 g C m?2 yr?1 and biomass density of 8?14 g C m?2. Over an ecosystem area of approximately 5.1 ? 1010 m2, the effect of sea otter predation on living kelp biomass alone represents a 4.4-to 8.7-teragram increase in C storage. At 2012 prices (US{\$}47 per ton of C), this stored C would be valued at US{\$}205 million?{\$}408 million on the European Carbon Exchange. Although questions remain concerning the pathways and compartments of kelp C flux and storage, sea otters undoubtedly have a strong influence on these elements of the C cycle. Predator-induced trophic cascades likely influence the rates of C flux and storage in many other species and ecosystems.},

Our study found that the attitude towards large carnivores was similar between farming enterprises but that conservancy members within each enterprise were more likely to be tolerant of large carnivores and to use livestock management options to reduce conflict, than non-conservancy members. Cause for concern however,was the high propor- tion of all farmers, including those belonging to conservancies, which reported removing large carnivores fromtheir farms.This aspect is reflected in the poor content of conservancy management plans with regard to large carnivore management and human–large carnivore conflict mitigation measures. The failure to incorporate guidelines pertaining to human– carnivore conflict management into conservancy management plans reflects the lack of a structured approach to solving this conflict on farmlands.},

abstract = {We present a general functional response model for herbivores exploiting well defined food items such as ramets of trees, shrubs and many herbs. The basic assumption in our analysis is that the partial consumption of ramets is a patch exploitation process. This allows us to derive not only testable, but also biologically realistic, functional responses with respect to both ramet and biomass density available to the herbivore. It is essential to know both measures in order to properly examine plant-herbivore dynamics. In both cases the functional response is typically Type II (continuously decelerating). Because individual ramets are treated as pat- ches, the functional response to a given total available biomass density is sensitive to both the number and size of ramets in the stand. This may have considerable effects on the plant-herbivore dynamics and on the growth form and life-history strategies of the plants under exploitation.},

abstract = {Predation on livestock is one of the main factors that cause the felids hunting, in particular for puma and jaguar this conflict with humans is severe. Most studies have assessed the predation impacts on livestock production; however there is a spatial pattern in attacks occurrence that is feasible to analyze from ecological niche modeling. The objective of this research was to generate a risk model of livestock predation by puma and jaguar in Mexico based on environmental and livestock management variables, which allows identification of zones of risk in order to define mitigation strategies at national level. We produced a geographic ensemble model of risk of predation from three algorithms for jaguar and five for puma. The variables most positively related with predation risk by jaguar were vegetative cover percentage, percentage of free grazing animals, and altitude, whereas arid vegetation has a negative influence on predation risk. In the case of puma the variables with highest contribution were livestock density, which negatively influences on the predation risk, in addition to forest and altitude, both with a positive relation. The ensemble models are an accurate approach to delineating the zones of predation risk by felids; however at a regional scale the environmental characteristics that favor predation may be different. It is recommended that researchers carry out studies for each biogeographic province that facilitate the identification of specific patterns and the definition of mitigation strategies most suitable for each one. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, all telemetry data have location error and no studies have reported the effects of error on utilization distribution and area estimates using fixed-kernel density estimators. We simulated different home range sizes and shapes by mixing bivariate-normal distributions and then drawing random samples of various sizes from these distributions. We compared fixed-kernel density estimates with and without error to the true underlying distributions. The effects of telemetry error on fixed-kernel density estimates were related to sample size, distribution complexity, and ratio of median Circular Error Probable to home range size. We suggest a metric to assess the adequacy of the telemetry system being used to estimate an animal's space use before a study is undertaken. Telemetry location error is unlikely to significantly affect fixed-kernel density estimates for most wildlife telemetry studies with adequate sample sizes.},

We conducted experiments that crossed six treatments consisting of zero, one, or two predator species (hellgrammites, greenside darters, and creek chubs) with three treatments in which we varied the density of mayfly prey. None of the multiple predator effects in our system were independent, and instead, the presence of multiple predator species resulted in risk reduction for the prey across both multiple predator combinations and all three levels of prey density. Risk reduction is likely to have population-level consequences for the prey, resulting in larger prey populations than would be predicted if the effects of multiple predator species were independent. For one of the two multiple predator combinations, the magnitude of risk reduction marginally increased with prey density. As a result, models predicting the combined risk from multiple predator species in this system will sometimes need to account for prey density as a factor influencing per-capita prey death rates.},

Home-range estimations have generally been disregarded as a means of quantifying habitat use and availability. Seasonal habitat use of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus)calculated from a home-range estimator using an adaptive kernel method was compared with relocation point data from Sand Lake National Wildlife Refuge, South Dakota from 1 January 1993 to 27 June 1994, to determine if an adaptive kernel home-range estimator approximates traditional methods of quantifying habitat use. No differences between proportional area of seasonal home-ranges and point data were detected (P{\textgreater}0{\textperiodcentered}05), indicating that habitat use calculated from an adaptive kernel home-range estimate was similar to habitat use calculated from relocation points. Potential benefits of home-range estimations include consideration of radio-telemetry error, biological independence of observations, and complete utilisation distributions. Given the success of home-range estimators at quantifying habitat use, a new alternative to habitat use analysis is offered. In situations where inherent telemetry error is unavoidable, using proportional area of home-range contours to define habitat use avoids the pitfalls associated with telemetry relocation point data.},

abstract = {Human-wildlife conflicts have drastically increased around conservation areas in Africa over the last decades. Underlying causes are similar across regions and can most often be attributed to land-use changes and increasing human populations. However, wildlife species composition involved in conflicts can vary tremendously across sites. Conflict assessment often focuses on prominent species such as elephants or other large mammals, and information on smaller wildlife species involved in conflicts is often lacking. We conducted 100 interviews in 10 communities around the Bia Conservation Area (BCA), Ghana, to address the type and extent of damage as well as possible factors influencing the risk of crop-raids. We assessed wildlife presence and relative densities through indirect observations on transects and spoor-plots in the transition zone between BCA and agricultural land. Crop-raiding was present across all communities interviewed but was more than twice as high in the north compared to the south. Squirrels (Sciuridae spp.) were the most frequent crop-raiding species (92{\%} of farmers experienced damage), but elephants (Loxodonta africana cyclotis [Matschie, 1900]) were nevertheless the major conflict generating species (84{\%} of farmers experienced damage). Squirrel signs were 75 times as frequent as any other species recorded in the farmland. Cocoa (Theobroma cacao) was most frequently raided (99{\%}), followed by cassava (Manihot esculenta) and yam (Dioscorea spp.). Raiding might have been promoted through inappropriate agricultural practices while only few current mitigation strategies have been successful so far. Promising strategies include chili fences and buffer zones, in which less susceptible crops such as chili pepper are planted. Further education of farmers on mitigation measures is needed, including training on improved farming practices. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier GmbH.},

Such 'mesopredator release' has been implicated in the decline and extinction of prey species. Because experimental manipulation of carnivores is logistically, financially and ethically problematic, however, few studies have evaluated how trophic cascades generated by the decline of dominant predators combine with other fragmentation effects to influence species diversity in terrestrial systems. Although the mesopredator release hypothesis has received only limited critical evaluation and remains controversial, it has become the basis for conservation programmes justifying the protection of carnivores. Here we describe a study that exploits spatial and temporal variation in the distribution and abundance of an apex predator, the coyote, in a landscape fragmented by development. It appears that the decline and disappearance of the coyote, in conjunction with the effects of habitat fragmentation, affect the distribution and abundance of smaller carnivores and the persistence of their avian prey.},

To prevent illegal uses of natural resources, such as poaching endangered species, governments have advocated granting policy flexibility to local authorities by liberalizing culling or hunting of large carnivores. We present the first quantitative evaluation of the hypothesis that liberalizing culling will reduce poaching and improve population status of an endangered carnivore. We show that allowing wolf (Canis lupus) culling was substantially more likely to increase poaching than reduce it. Replicated, quasi-experimental changes in wolf policies in Wisconsin and Michigan, USA, revealed that a repeated policy signal to allow state culling triggered repeated slowdowns in wolf population growth, irrespective of the policy implementation measured as the number of wolves killed. The most likely explanation for these slowdowns was poaching and alternative explanations found no support. When the government kills a protected species, the perceived value of each individual of that species may decline; so liberalizing wolf culling may have sent a negative message about the value of wolves or acceptability of poaching. Our results suggest that granting management flexibility for endangered species to address illegal behaviour may instead promote such behaviour.},

As many of these communities are Maasai, research and conservation efforts have focused on understanding and curbing Maasai lion hunting practices. Much of this work has been informed by a dichotomous explanatory model of Maasai lion hunting as either a ‘cultural' ritual or a ‘retaliatory' behaviour against predation on livestock. We present qualitative data from interviews (n = 246) in both countries to illustrate that lion hunting by Maasai is related to overlapping motivations that are simultaneously social, emotional and political (in response to conservation initiatives). Additional case study material from Tanzania highlights how politics associated with conservation activities and age-set dynamics affect lion hunting in complex and overlapping ways. Our findings contribute an ethnographic perspective on Maasai lion hunting, people–predator relations, and how these relations are linked to conservation politics.},

Live-traps were constructed that allowed the identification of crop raiding animals; pest species could be disposed of and threatened species released unharmed. However, by 2004 none of the traps in the study area were functioning and interviews were conducted to assess the reasons for their decline and local people's accep- tance of the intervention. Forty-one percent of respon- dents did not believe the strategy was effective and the majority of local farmers did not accept responsibility or the traps. This was because of operational failures in four areas: (1) the identification of key stakeholders, (2) objective evaluation to assess the efficacy and benefit of the intervention, (3) participatory monitoring and evaluation, and (4) long-term funding commitment by conservation agencies. We examine the impact of these four elements upon the sustainability of the live-trap programme and stress the importance of recognizing and reporting failures to develop effective and accep- table mitigation strategies.},

abstract = {Mammalian herbivores can carry out multiple tasks without interrupting food processing, but this possibility is not considered in existing foraging models. We develop a mechanistic functional response to account for herbivores' ability to search for their next food bite and walk away from competitors while chewing vegetation. We demonstrate how the possibility of multi-tasking can buffer intake rate from competition and vigilance. The functional response of herbivores can be density independent until a threshold of competitors is reached in the food patch, and only then does it become density dependent. Herbivores also should be capable of maintaining food intake rate, despite important resource depletion in the foraging patch. The possibility of animal movements during food processing offers herbivores opportunities for cost-free vigilance. When individuals find their next bite before they have finished chewing the current bite, the remaining chewing time becomes "spare time" that could be spent in vigilance without reducing food intake rate. Modeling of optimal vigilance demonstrates that such cost-free vigilance might importantly alter expected patterns of scanning by mammalian herbivores. Assuming that interference increases with competitor density, spare time available for scanning should decrease as the number of herbivores in a food patch increases. Foraging constraints on food intake thus can provide a mechanistic explanation for the commonly observed decline in herbivore vigilance with increasing group size.},

The effects of sampling and other transformations that convert one data type to another are discussed; the possible loss of spatial information is considered. Techniques for analyzing spatial pattern, developed in plant ecology, animal ecology, landscape ecology, geostatistics and applied statistics are reviewed briefly and their overlap in methodology and philosophy noted. The techniques are categorized according to their output and the inferences that may be drawn from them, in a discursive style without formulae. Methods are compared for four case studies with field data covering a range of types. These are: 1) percentage cover of three shrubs along a line transect; 2) locations and volume of a desert plant in a 1 ha area; 3) a remotely-sensed spectral index and elevation from 105 km2 of a mountainous region; and 4) land cover from three rangeland types within 800 km2 of a coastal region. Initial approaches utilize mapping, frequency distributions and variance-mean indices. Analysis techniques we compare include: local quadrat variance, block quadrat variance, correlograms, variograms, angular correlation, directional variograms, wavelets, SADIE, nearest neighbour methods, Ripley's L  (t), and various landscape ecology metrics. Our advice to ecologists is to use simple visualization techniques for initial analysis, and subsequently to select methods that are appropriate for the data type and that answer their specific questions of interest. It is usually prudent to employ several different techniqu},

abstract = {The threat posed by large carnivores to livestock and humans makes peaceful coexistence between them difficult. Effective implementation of conservation laws and policies depends on the attitudes of local residents toward the target species. There are many known correlates of human attitudes toward carnivores, but they have only been assessed at the scale of the individual. Because human societies are organized hierarchically, attitudes are presumably influenced by different factors at different scales of social organization, but this scale dependence has not been examined. We used structured interview surveys to quantitatively assess the attitudes of a Buddhist pastoral community toward snow leopards (Panthera uncia) and wolves (Canis lupus). We interviewed 381 individuals from 24 villages within 6 study sites across the high-elevation Spiti Valley in the Indian Trans-Himalaya. We gathered information on key explanatory variables that together captured variation in individual and village-level socioeconomic factors. We used hierarchical linear models to examine how the effect of these factors on human attitudes changed with the scale of analysis from the individual to the community. Factors significant at the individual level were gender, education, and age of the respondent (for wolves and snow leopards), number of income sources in the family (wolves), agricultural production, and large-bodied livestock holdings (snow leopards). At the community level, the significant factors included the number of smaller-bodied herded livestock killed by wolves and mean agricultural production (wolves) and village size and large livestock holdings (snow leopards). Our results show that scaling up from the individual to higher levels of social organization can highlight important factors that influence attitudes of people toward wildlife and toward formal conservation efforts in general. Such scale-specific information can help managers apply conservation measures at appropriate scales. Our results reiterate the need for conflict management programs to be multipronged.

As an epidemiological interesting finding, spread behavior was shown to depend on type in addition to age: basic reproduction numbers were 0.25 (95{\%} CI 0.19-0.34) and 0.11 (95{\%} CI 0.07-0.17) for types B:P1.7-2,4:F1-5 and C:P1.5,2:F3-3, respectively. Altogether, the proposed methodology represents a comprehensive and universal regression framework for the modeling, simulation, and inference of self-exciting spatiotemporal point processes based on the CIF.

abstract = {Structured questionnaires and semi-structured interviews are often used in mixed method studies to generate confirmatory results despite differences in methods of data collection, analysis, and interpretation. A review of 19 questionnaire-interview comparison studies found that consensus and consistency statistics were generally weak between methods. Problems in aligning data from the two different methods are illustrated in a questionnaire-interview study of teacher conceptions of assessment. Poor alignment appeared attributable to: differences in data collection procedures, the complexity and instability of the construct being investigated, difficulties in making data comparable, lack of variability in participant responses, greater sensitivity to context and seemingly emotive responses within the interview, possible misinterpretation of some questionnaire prompts, and greater control of content exposure in the questionnaire. Results indicated that if ‘confirmatory' results are being sought, researchers must create tightly aligned and structured instruments; present the construct in a simple, concrete, and highly contextualised manner; collect the two types of data with a minimal time gap; and estimate agreement between methods using consistency statistics. However, the cost of confirmation through strong alignment may lead to the loss of rich complementary data obtained through allowing each method to be analysed in its own right},

abstract = {The size and composition of three herds belonging to Maasai pastoralists were monitored for more than 5 years (1990 to 1996). Animals were categorized as either suckling calves, weaned heifers, weaned males or breeding females. The dates of entries and exits were used to estimate the total number of observed animal days for each category. Fertility rates of breeding females and mortality and disposal rates for each category were estimated using animal days as the denominator. Herd differences were tested using contingency tables. Age to first calving and calving intervals were estimated and examined using analysis of variance tests. The patterns of births and deaths were seasonally influenced. The mean annual calving rate of all breeding females was 65.6{\%} and for females excluding first calvers was 46.9{\%}. No herd effects were observed. The mean observed interval between calvings was 609 days and the calving interval, calculated from the parturition rate, was 649 days with no herd differences. Mean age at first calving was approximately 4 years with no herd differences. Mean annual mortality rates were 8.9{\%} for breeding cows, 7.8{\%} for weaned males, 6.7{\%} for weaned heifers and 22.1{\%} for calves. The mean annual culling rate of cows teas 10.8{\%} and the sale rate of heifers and weaned males was 12.9{\%} and 41.5{\%} respectively. The mean age at disposal of heifers was 655 days and of steers was 801 days. Herd sizes were shown to fluctuate annually with no obvious trend between herds. The main determinants of production identified were the effect of seasonally poor nutrition on the rate of reproduction and the effect of season, herd mobility and disease on mortality. The study describes production levels that can be used to predict future changes to the system. The results are discussed in terms of the factors influencing and their relevance to pastoral development. The findings are compared with those observed in other, similar areas.},

abstract = {The overlap of large carnivores, livestock and people can engender conflicts that often threaten the future viability of carnivore populations in the pastoral systems of Africa. A playback survey of lions Panthera leo, spotted hyenas Crocuta crocuta and black-backed jackals Canis mesomelas and a transect count of wild herbivores was conducted in the Maasai Mara National Reserve and adjoining pastoral ranches to assess the effect of pastoralism and protection on the density and distribution of carnivores in June 2003. Reliability of the prey counts depended on an assumption of similar observability between the protected and pastoral areas, which we assessed using distance sampling in November 2003 and computer simulations and determined to be similar. Estimates of wild prey biomass density was 2.6 times higher in the ranches (14212 kg/km2) than in the reserve (5472 kg/km2) during this wet season count. Apparent hyena density estimates were 1.3 times higher in the ranches (0.561 hyenas/km2) than in the reserve (0.404 hyenas/km 2), in correspondence with the regional pattern of prey density. This distribution of hyenas is biased towards the reserve, if it is dependent on prey density. Estimates of apparent jackal density were similar in both areas whereas lion density was anomalously 8.0 times lower in the ranches (0.046 lions/km2) than in the reserve (0.369 lions/km2). Lion and hyena densities and prey biomass did not differ between June 1991 (5172.273 kg/km2) and June 2003 (5472 kg/km2) in the reserve, but jackal density increased in the same period. Lions never responded to playbacks in the ranches, so the potential shift in lion behavioural response for different land use zones is another potential explanation for the patterns found here. We think a real shift in lion populations is a better explanation than a behavioural change in relation to playbacks based on additional data from independent systematic and intensive censuses and playback surveys conducted in the ranches. Lion populations in the pastoral ranches seemed headed for extinction, probably owing to conflicts with pastoralism, necessitating urgent conservation interventions that integrate pastoral economic welfare with large carnivore conservation goals to foster long-term viability of lion populations in the pastoral systems. 2005 The Zoological Society of London.},

abstract = {We investigated the spatial distribution of radio-marked wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) in the Serengeti ecosystem in relation to the distribution of their food resources, comparing patterns in the wet and dry seasons and at local and landscape spatial scales. A mechanistic model of ruminant energy optimization predicted that wildebeest should maximize energy intake on swards 3 cm high and maintain energy balance on swards between 3 and 10 cm high. At the ecosystem scale, wildebeest preferred short and intermediate-height grass of moderate greenness during both the wet and dry seasons. This was consistent with the model prediction which suggests that large-scale movements by wildebeest are motivated, at least partially, by an energy-maximizing strategy. At the local scale, however, wildebeest showed spatial selectivity only on the basis of grass greenness, not on grass height. This differed from model expectations and may have resulted from wildebeest exploiting ephemeral green flushes of grass caused by localized rainfall in their movement radius. According to these results, the influence of other nutritional or behavioural factors on wildebeest distributions is not rejected, yet they suggest the potentially important role of an energy intake maximizing strategy on movement patterns. Our findings show that wildebeest movements are broadly similar to those of other large herbivores that migrate in response to resource gradients.},

abstract = {Conflicts between humans and predators are the product of socio-economic and political landscapes and are particularly controversial because the resources concerned have economic value and the predators involved are high profile and often legally protected. We surveyed the current literature for information on ecological and social factors common to human-predator-prey conflicts. We used this information to examine whether losses to predators and patterns of investment in husbandry could be linked to these factors. We found that livestock losses to predators were low and were negatively associated with net primary productivity and predator home range sizes, but were not affected by predator density, methods of husbandry or human population density. While there was no effect of husbandry on losses, variation in husbandry was explained by net primary productivity, predator density and percentage of stock killed by predators. Inconsistent and sparse data across conflicts may have limited our ability to identify important factors and resolve patterns, and suggests that there is no reliable or consistent framework for assessing and managing human-predator conflicts that involve game and livestock species. Our approach highlights the type of data that could be very informative to management if collected across a range of cases and habitats. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Two types of collars were used on nine cows: radio frequency and global system for mobile communications (GSM) collars and GPS-satellite (SAT) collars. Full results of cattle tracking were available for eight cows (3 GSM and 5 SAT) tracked between July 2008 and September 2010. A cumulative total of 1556 tracking days was recorded over the 17 month period. On average cows walked 10,203. m/day (average total monthly distance walked was 234. km). Significant seasonal differences were found; on average cows walked 9.607. m and 10,392. m per day in the rainy and the dry seasons, respectively. This difference was also significant for total monthly and daily distance walked between the dry and the rainy season. On average cows walked daily 9607. m and 10,392. m on the rainy and the dry season respectively. During the dry months a 48. h cycle was observed with cows walking 15-25. km to water every 2nd day but only 5-8. km/day between watering days. There was a 24{\%} overlap of cattle range with both elephants and zebras. This study demonstrated the feasibility of tracking cattle using radio collars. It shows the complexity of spatial use by cattle and wildlife. Such information can be used to understand the dynamics of disease transmission between livestock and wildlife. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Camera station-specific estimates of species richness ranged from 8 to 27 unique species, and species had a mean occurrence probability of 0{\textperiodcentered}32 (95{\%} credible interval = 0{\textperiodcentered}21–0{\textperiodcentered}45). At the community level, our model revealed species richness was generally greatest in floodplains and grasslands and with increasing distances into protected wildlife areas. * Variation among species' responses was explained in part by our species groupings. The positive influence of protected areas was strongest for extra-large species and herbivores, while medium-sized species actually increased in the non-protected areas. The positive effect of grassland/floodplain cover, alternatively, was strongest for large species and carnivores and weakest for small species and herbivores, suggesting herbivore diversity is promoted by habitat heterogeneity. * Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight the importance of protected areas and grasslands in maintaining biodiversity in southern Africa. We demonstrate the utility of hierarchical Bayesian models for assessing community, group and individual species' responses to anthropogenic and environmental variables. This framework can be used to map areas of high conservation value and predict impacts of land-use change. Our approach is particularly applicable to the growing number of camera trap studies world-wide, and we suggest broader application globally will likely result in reduced costs, improved efficiency and increased knowledge of wildlife communities.},

The present study comprises of fourteen autopsy cases conducted at the department of Forensic Medicine, B.S Medical College, Bankura, West Bengal, India over a period of three years. The study attempts to find out the nature of injuries caused by wild elephant attack and the common factors contributing to human-wild elephant conflict so that vulnerable population can be cautioned to avoid conflicts. A distinct seasonal as well as diurnal variation of attack incidences was noted. Attacks were sudden and unprovoked. Killer elephants were wild tuskers in all the cases.

abstract = {Successful conservation of large terrestrial mammals (wildlife) on private lands requires that landowners be empowered to manage wildlife so that benefits outweigh the costs. Laikipia County, Kenya, is predominantly unfenced, and the land uses in the area allow wide-ranging wildlife to move freely between different management systems on private land. We used camera traps to sample large mammals associated with 4 different management systems (rhinoceros sanctuaries, no livestock; conservancies, intermediate stocking level; fenced ranches, high stocking level; and group ranches, high stocking level, no fencing, pastoralist clan ownership) to examine whether management and stocking levels affect wildlife. We deployed cameras at 522 locations across 8 properties from January 2008 through October 2010 and used the photographs taken during this period to estimate richness, occupancy, and relative abundance of species. Species richness was highest in conservancies and sanctuaries and lowest on fenced and group ranches. Occupancy estimates were, on average, 2 and 5 times higher in sanctuaries and conservancies as on fenced and group ranches, respectively. Nineteen species on fenced ranches and 25 species on group ranches were considered uncommon (occupancy {\textless} 0.1). The relative abundance of most species was highest or second highest in sanctuaries and conservancies. Lack of rights to manage and utilize wildlife and uncertain land tenure dampen many owners' incentives to tolerate wildlife. We suggest national conservation strategies consider landscape-level approaches to land-use planning that aim to increase conserved areas by providing landowners with incentives to tolerate wildlife. Possible incentives include improving access to ecotourism benefits, forging agreements to maintain wildlife habitat and corridors, resolving land-ownership conflicts, restoring degraded rangelands, expanding opportunities for grazing leases, and allowing direct benefits to landowners through wildlife harvesting. .},

We examined patterns of livestock depredation by jaguars (Panthera onca) and pumas (Puma concolor) on a ranch-wildlife reserve in western Brazil to assess factors contributing to prey mortality. We predicted jaguars would kill a greater proportion of calves than yearling and adult cattle and that proximity to suitable habitat would increase mortality risk. We further speculated that exposure to predation risk would promote livestock grouping and increased movement distance. We recorded 169 cattle mortality incidents during 2003 2004, of which 19{\%} were due to predation by jaguars and pumas. This level of mortality represented 0.2-0.3{\%} of the total livestock holdings on the ranch. Jaguars caused most (69{\%}) cattle predation events, and survival in allotments was lower for calves than for other age classes. Forest proximity was the only variable we found to explain patterns of livestock mortality, with predation risk increasing as distance to forest cover declined. Due to low predation risk, cattle movement patterns and grouping behavior did not vary relative to level of spatial overlap with radiocollared jaguars. The overall effect of predation on cattle was low and livestock likely constituted an alternative prey for large cats in our study area. However, selection of calves over other age cohorts and higher predation risk among cattle in proximity to forest cover is suggestive of selection of substandard individuals. Cattle ranchers in the Pantanal region may reduce cattle mortality rates by concentrating on losses due to nonpredation causes that could be more easily controlled.},

abstract = {Conflict between wildlife and people can erode local support for conservation. Wildlife-based benefits are intended to offset costs and encourage tolerance or stewardship, but where the linkage between benefits and wildlife is not understood, benefits may be ineffective at bolstering conservation. In Laikipia, Kenya, wildlife and areas devoted to wildlife are on the increase, but most residents still suffer losses to wildlife and derive minimal benefits. The elephant situation is particularly problematic because elephants may compete with livestock for resources, raid people's crops, and chase and kill livestock and people. Although most unprotected elephant range in East Africa is in semi-arid rangelands occupied by pastoralists, previous research has emphasized agricultural, not pastoral or agri-pastoral conflicts. Between 1999 and 2002, interviews were conducted in Laikipia District to examine whether pastoralists also experience conflict, and to determine whether wildlife conservation provided appreciable benefits to residents, or fostered pro-conservation attitudes among residents. Three properties, Endana, Koija and Mpala, were selected to include the two primary land uses in Laikipia (livestock and agriculture) and two levels of wildlife-based benefits (indirect benefits and direct benefits from a locally-owned tourism operation). People were negative about many aspects of local wildlife conservation, especially animals that raided crops or were dangerous. Fundamental differences in attitudes were attributable to primary land use; within ethnic groups, people practising agriculture were less tolerant of elephants than people practising pastoralism. Despite evidence that elephants may compete with livestock for forage, ecological competition was not a primary concern among cattle-keeping people. In communities that received indirect benefits from tourism or wildlife, the connection between wildlife and employment or aid in kind was usually overlooked. Unlike elsewhere in Africa, education and wealth did not correlate with positive attitudes towards wildlife because the tourism programme was improving the situation and the outlook of people lacking education and material wealth. Pastoral people with indirect financial benefits expressed positive attitudes towards elephants for aesthetic reasons, while pastoral people with direct benefits cited financial rewards derived from tourism but attributed aesthetic values to living with elephants. The programme in the pastoral community receiving benefits was exemplary in that benefits were tangible, and the participants appreciated the linkage between benefits and active conservation. Land conversion from pastoralism to agriculture threatens elephant survival, not only in terms of habitat loss, but also in terms of lost tolerance among people who have shifted to farming.},

abstract = {Conventional approaches to natural resource management are increasingly challenged by environmental problems that are embedded in highly complex systems with profound uncertainties. These so-called social-ecological sys- tems (SESs) are characterized by strong links between the so- cial and the ecological system and multiple interactions across spatial and temporal scales. New approaches are needed to manage those tightly coupled systems; however, basic under- standing of their nonlinear behavior is still missing. Modeling is a traditional tool in natural resource management to study complex, dynamic systems. There is a long tradition of SES modeling, but the approach is now being more widely recog- nized in other fields, such as ecological and economic model- ing, where issues such as nonlinear ecological dynamics and complex human decision making are receiving more attention. SES modeling is maturing as a discipline in its own right, in- corporating ideas from other interdisciplinary fields such as resilience or complex systems research. In this paper, we pro- vide an overview of the emergence and state of the art of this cross-cutting field. Our analysis reveals the substantial potential of SES models to address issues that are of utmost importance for managing complex human-environment rela- tionships, such as: (i) the implications of ecological and social structure for resource management, (ii) uncertainty in natural and social systems and ways to address it, (iii) the role of co- evolutionary processes in the dynamics of SESs, and (iv) the implications of microscale human decision making for sustain- able resource management and conservation. The complexity of SESs and the lack of a common analytical framework, how- ever, also pose significant challenges for this emerging field. There are clear research needs with respect to: (i) approaches that go beyond rather simple specifications of human deci- sion making, (ii) development of coping strategies to deal with (irreducible) uncertainties, (iii) more explicit modeling of feed- backs between the social and ecological systems, and (iv) a conceptual and methodological framework for analyzing and modeling SESs. We provide ideas for tackling some of these challenges and indicate potential key focal areas for SES mod- eling in the future.},

abstract = {Aim (1) To estimate the local and global magnitude of carbon fluxes between savanna and the atmosphere, and to suggest the significance of savannas in the global carbon cycle. (2) To suggest the extent to which protection of savannas could contribute to a global carbon sequestration initiative. Location Tropical savanna ecosystems in Africa, Australia, India and South America. Methods A literature search was carried out using the ISI Web of Knowledge, and a compilation of extra data was obtained from other literature, including national reports accessed through the personal collections of the authors. Savanna is here defined as any tropical ecosystem containing grasses, including woodland and grassland types. From these data it was possible to estimate the fluxes of carbon dioxide between the entire savanna biome on a global scale. Results Tropical savannas can be remarkably productive, with a net primary productivity that ranges from 1 to 12 t C ha−1 year−1. The lower values are found in the arid and semi-arid savannas occurring in extensive regions of Africa, Australia and South America. The global average of the cases reviewed here was 7.2 t C ha−1 year−1. The carbon sequestration rate (net ecosystem productivity) may average 0.14 t C ha−1 year−1 or 0.39 Gt C year−1. If savannas were to be protected from fire and grazing, most of them would accumulate substantial carbon and the sink would be larger. Savannas are under anthropogenic pressure, but this has been much less publicized than deforestation in the rain forest biome. The rate of loss is not well established, but may exceed 1{\%} per year, approximately twice as fast as that of rain forests. Globally, this is likely to constitute a flux to the atmosphere that is at least as large as that arising from deforestation of the rain forest. Main conclusions The current rate of loss impacts appreciably on the global carbon balance. There is considerable scope for using many of the savannas as sites for carbon sequestration, by simply protecting them from burning and grazing, and permitting them to increase in stature and carbon content over periods of several decades.},

abstract = {1. Approximately half of the remaining Zanzibar red colobus Procolobus kirkii, one of Africa's most endangered primates, reside permanently outside protected areas, many within agricultural areas. Consequently, conservation of this endangered species is strongly dependent on the development of effective management plans that address the potential human-wildlife conflicts in these agricultural areas. 2. There are a growing number of complaints about red colobus consumption of coconuts in the agricultural areas and requests by local farmers for compensation and/or removal of the colobus. Prior to taking actions that would hinder the conservation of this highly endangered species, it is necessary to quantify and compare the actual impact of the colobus on coconut harvest with that perceived by the farmers. 3. In this study we monitored five experimental and two control plots to quantify the potential impact of red colobus on coconut crops and to assess the ecological variables that may influence this impact. 4. We found that red colobus consumption of coconuts was highest in areas of high red colobus density and low availability of alternative red colobus food resources. Despite these correlations, red colobus feeding on immature coconuts did not appear to limit coconut harvest. On the contrary, red colobus consumption of coconuts was found to be positively correlated with harvest. This correlation is probably due to a pruning effect. 5. Based upon our findings that red colobus are having no significant negative impact on coconut harvest and are actually a source of tourist revenue to the region, we recommend no action be taken to remove colobus from the agricultural areas. 6. This study illustrates the importance of scientific documentation of perceived human-wildlife conflicts.},

abstract = {Top predators have often been persecuted because of their supposed negative effects on species of economic concern on which they feed. In some cases, however, they may actually benefit their prey through intraguild predation on other smaller predators that share the prey. In each of two representative situations, in one of which lynx were present and in the other absent, we (1) estimated gross number of rabbits taken by lynx and Egyptian mongooses (smaller predators that are themselves preyed upon by lynx; (2) simulated size-structured rabbit populations of different densities, taking into account the reproductive value of the individuals taken by predators; and (3) estimated actual rabbit densities. Numbers of rabbits taken by predators during a year were found to be between 4.8 and 9.5 times greater when lynx were not present. After a year, rabbit population growth for an initial rabbit density of 15/ha was between 12{\%} and 22{\%} lower when lynx were not present. For lower initial rabbit densities, the positive effect of lynx presence on rabbits was greater. Actual rabbit densities in the areas used by lynx were 2-4 times higher than in areas not used by lynx, even though these areas were similar or identical in habitat composition. These results support the suggestion that removal of top predators may sometimes have a negative effect on prey populations of human economic concern. Los grandes predadores han sido con frecuencia perseguidos porque se ha supuesto que causan un efecto negativo sobre las especies de presas de interes economico de las que se alimentan. Sin embargo, en algunos casos, podrian afectar positivamente a sus presas si predan sobre otros predadores que tambien se altimentan de las mismas presas. En cada una de dos situaciones representativas (presencia y ausencia de linces) en Donana (Suroeste de Espana), se estimo el consumo bruto de conejos por parte de linces y meloncillos (un predador pequeno que puede predado por linces), se simulo una poblacion de conejos con la que tambien se pudo considerar el valor reproductivo de los individuos capturados por ambos predadores, y se estimo la densidad real de conejos. El numero de conejos consumidos en ausencia de linces fue entre 4.8 y 9.5 veces mayor que en su presencia, independientemente del tamano de los mismos. Las tasas de crecimiento despues de un ano de la poblacion de conejos simulada fueron entre un 12{\%} menores en ausencia de linces. Para densidades menores de conejos el efecto positivo de la presencia del lince fue mayor. Bajo densidades de conejos y predadores poco realistas la presencia del lince no tuvo un efecto positivo sobre las poblaciones de conejos. Las densidades reales de conejos en las areas usadas por linces fueron de 2-4 veces mas elevadas que en las areas no usadas por linces, a pesar de que las areas comparadas fueron similares o identicas en vegetacion. Estos resultados apoyan la idea de que la eliminacion de los grandes predadores puede tener un efecto negativo sobre las poblaciones de presas que son de interes economico para el hombre.},

abstract = {Conflicts between humans and predators are the product of socio-economic and political landscapes and are particularly controversial because the resources concerned have economic value and the predators involved are high profile and often legally protected. We surveyed the current literature for information on ecological and social factors common to human-predator-prey conflicts. We used this information to examine whether losses to predators and patterns of investment in husbandry could be linked to these factors. We found that livestock losses to predators were low and were negatively associated with net primary productivity and predator home range sizes, but were not affected by predator density, methods of husbandry or human population density. While there was no effect of husbandry on losses, variation in husbandry was explained by net primary productivity, predator density and percentage of stock killed by predators. Inconsistent and sparse data across conflicts may have limited our ability to identify important factors and resolve patterns, and suggests that there is no reliable or consistent framework for assessing and managing human-predator conflicts that involve game and livestock species. Our approach highlights the type of data that could be very informative to management if collected across a range of cases and habitats. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In analogy with genes, memes can be conceived as cultural units that can be transmitted from one generation to another.

abstract = {African lion (Panthera leo) populations are in decline throughout most of Africa, but the problem is particularly acute in southern Kenya, where Maasai people are spearing and poisoning lions at a rate that will ensure near term local extinction. Lion killing is shaped by Maasai perception of livestock depredation, socio-economic factors, and the complex relationship between Maasai and conservation. These all affect tolerance for lions and consequently Maasai behavior towards conservation initiatives and carnivores in general. We used an in-depth quantitative questionnaire and participatory rural appraisals (PRAs) to identify the social and ecological predictors of lion killing and to investigate the effect of a compensation scheme on individual tolerance. Individuals who lose a greater proportion of their livestock to predators relative to their overall livestock loss, those affiliated with an evangelical church, and those who mainly sell rather than accumulate livestock all reported a higher propensity to kill carnivores. The future of carnivore conservation in this region depends on a better understanding of the nuances of human-carnivore conflict and a concerted effort to address appropriate cultural and community-level institutions, chiefly by providing economic benefits to local people who engage in positive conservation activities. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Type II functional responses are frequently observed in herbivores feeding in Patches where plants are concentrated in space. We tested a mechanistic model of regulation of intake rate of herbivores foraging in food-concentrated patches (Laca and Demment 1992, Spalinger and Hobbs 1992) that accounts for asymptotic, Type II responses. The model is based on the hypothesis that competition between cropping and chewing regulates instantaneous intake rate in response to changes in the size of bites obtained by the forager. We tested this hypothesis and examined the ability of our model to account for observations of intake rate of 12 species of mammalian herbivores ranging in body mass over 4 orders of magnitude. We measured short-term intake rates of mammalian herbivores feeding in hand-assembled patches of plants. We varied bite size by changing plant height and density in patches offered to herbivores, and observed dry matter intake rates in response to this variation. Averaged across species, our model accounted for 77{\%} of the variance in food intake rate (P {\textless} .001 for all species). Predictions of maximum intake rate closely resembled observations of processing capacity, demonstrating that processing rather than cropping sets an upper limit on short-term intake. Tests of model mechanisms provided strong support for the hypothesis that competition between cropping and chewing is responsible for the Type II functional response seen in herbivores feeding in food-concentrated patches. The model was able to consistently predict intake rates observed in 16 previous studies. These results indicate that plant characteristics regulating bite size (e.g., leaf size and geometry, spinescence) frequently control instantaneous rates of food intake by mammalian herbivores.},

abstract = {The killing of jaguars by ranchers in Amazonia and the Pantanal is a major threat to the species. We used the Theory of Planned Behavior to examine the role of ranchers' perceptions, norms, attitudes and intentions concerning jaguar killing, in determining their jaguar-killing behavior. We also investigated the influence of: (1) descriptive norm and social identity on ranchers' intention to kill jaguars on their properties; and (2) the effect of perceptions of jaguar impact on human livelihoods (livestock and human safety), and of property size, on the variables that influence intention to kill. Results based on interviews with 268 cattle ranchers indicated that the impact of jaguars on livestock is not the only predictor of a rancher's intention to kill jaguars. Fear, personal and social motivations, and internal and external barriers (e.g. lack of skills and force of law, respectively) to killing jaguars can also influence jaguar killing. The relative importance of these factors in determining intention to kill varies with region and affluence. We recommend ways of deterring jaguar killing behavior through communication interventions. In addition to the economic and legal incentives that have already been considered by conservationists, effective strategies to protect jaguars on privately owned land will need to address the social and psychological factors that determine the killing of jaguars by ranchers. Conservationists need to find and support ways to make jaguar killing not only unprofitable and illegal, but also socially and personally unacceptable. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Recently we have shown, using theoretical analysis, that the dynamics of social diffusion may depend crucially upon the interactions of social network communities, that is, densely connected groupings of individuals which have only relatively few links to other groups. This paper presents an empirical investigation of two hypotheses which follow from this finding: 1.) the presence of even just a few inter-community links can make diffusion activity in one community a significant predictor of activity in otherwise disparate communities and 2.) very early dispersion of a diffusion process across network communities is a reliable early indicator that the diffusion will ultimately involve a substantial number of individuals. We explore these hypotheses with case studies involving emergence of the Swedish Social Democratic Party at the turn of the 20th century, the spread of SARS in 2002{\&}{\#}x2013;2003, and blogging dynamics associated with potentially incendiary real world occurrences. These empirical studies demonstrate that network community-based diffusion metrics do indeed possess predictive power, and in fact can be significantly more predictive than standard measures.},

abstract = {* Emerging conservation paradigms have shifted from single to multi-species approaches focused on sustaining biodiversity. Multi-species hierarchical occupancy modelling provides a method for assessing biodiversity while accounting for multiple sources of uncertainty. * We analysed camera trapping data with multi-species models using a Bayesian approach to estimate the distributions of a terrestrial mammal community in northern Botswana and evaluate community, group, and species-specific responses to human disturbance and environmental variables. Groupings were based on two life-history traits: body size (small, medium, large and extra-large) and diet (carnivore, omnivore and herbivore). * We photographed 44 species of mammals over 6607 trap nights. Camera station-specific estimates of species richness ranged from 8 to 27 unique species, and species had a mean occurrence probability of 0{\textperiodcentered}32 (95{\%} credible interval = 0{\textperiodcentered}21–0{\textperiodcentered}45). At the community level, our model revealed species richness was generally greatest in floodplains and grasslands and with increasing distances into protected wildlife areas. * Variation among species' responses was explained in part by our species groupings. The positive influence of protected areas was strongest for extra-large species and herbivores, while medium-sized species actually increased in the non-protected areas. The positive effect of grassland/floodplain cover, alternatively, was strongest for large species and carnivores and weakest for small species and herbivores, suggesting herbivore diversity is promoted by habitat heterogeneity. * Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight the importance of protected areas and grasslands in maintaining biodiversity in southern Africa. We demonstrate the utility of hierarchical Bayesian models for assessing community, group and individual species' responses to anthropogenic and environmental variables. This framework can be used to map areas of high conservation value and predict impacts of land-use change. Our approach is particularly applicable to the growing number of camera trap studies world-wide, and we suggest broader application globally will likely result in reduced costs, improved efficiency and increased knowledge of wildlife communities.},

abstract = {Mammalian carnivores have suffered the biggest range contraction among all biodiversity and are particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation. Therefore, we identified priority areas for the conservation of mammalian carnivores, while accounting for species-specific requirements for connectivity and expected agricultural and urban expansion. While prioritizing for carnivores only, we were also able to test their effectiveness as surrogates for 23,110 species of amphibians, birds, mammals and reptiles and 867 terrestrial ecoregions. We then assessed the risks to carnivore conservation within each country that makes a contribution to global carnivore conservation. We found that land use change will potentially lead to important range losses, particularly amongst already threatened carnivore species. In addition, the 17{\%} of land targeted for protection under the Aichi Target 11 was found to be inadequate to conserve carnivores under expected land use change. Our results also highlight that land use change will decrease the effectiveness of carnivores to protect other threatened species, especially threatened amphibians. In addition, the risk of human-carnivore conflict is potentially high in countries where we identified spatial priorities for their conservation. As meeting the global biodiversity target will be inadequate for carnivore protection, innovative interventions are needed to conserve carnivores outside protected areas to compliment any proposed expansion of the protected area network.},

abstract = {Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) biomass has declined in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) in the past century. We installed permanent belt transects (plots) for long-term monitoring of aspen stands both within and outside of established wolf pack territories on YNP's northern range to determine if reintroduced wolves are influencing elk browsing patterns and aspen regeneration through a trophic cascades interaction. Wolves may have an indirect effect on aspen regeneration by altering elk movements, browsing patterns, and foraging behavior (predation risk effects). Elk pellet groups, aspen sucker heights, and the percentage of browsed suckers were the variables used to measure differences in aspen stands in high and low wolf-use areas of the northern range. The aspen stands in the high wolf-use areas had significantly lower counts of elk pellet groups in the mesic upland steppe and the combined mesic upland steppe and riparian/wet meadow habitat types. Based on our pellet group results, it appears that elk foraging behaviors may have been altered by the increased risk of predation due to the reintroduction of the wolf. In the riparian/wet meadow habitat type, mean aspen sucker heights were significantly higher in the high wolf-use areas than in the low wolf-use areas. The percentage of browsed suckers in high and low wolf-use areas showed no significant differences in any of the habitat types. Considering the high browsing pressure in YNP aspen stands, it is uncertain whether the taller aspen suckers measured in the high wolf-use areas will eventually join the aspen overstory. These permanent plots represent a valuable baseline data set to assess any current and future aspen regeneration responses to the reintroduction of wolves in YNP. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Despite dramatic transformations in conservation rhetoric regarding local people, indigenous rights, and community- oriented approaches, conservation in many places in Tanzania today continues to infringe on human rights. This happens through the exclusion of local people as knowledgeable active participants in management, policy formation, and decision-making processes in land that ‘belongs' to them and on which their livelihoods depend. In this paper, I focus on a relatively new conservation area designed on the Conservation Trust Model—Manyara Ranch in Monduli district in northern Tanzania. I present this case as a conservation opportunity lost, where local Maasai who were initially interested in utilising the area for conservation, have come to resent and disrespect the conservation status of the area, after having lost it from their ownership and control. I illustrate how the denial of Maasai memories, knowledge, and management practices in Manyara Ranch threaten the future viability of the place both for conservation and for Maasai use. The paper contributes to a growing literature as well as a set of concerns regarding the relationship between conservation and human rights.},

The method is increasingly used in studies of spatial distribution patterns of plant communities, but the statistical methods involved are sometimes poorly understood or have been modified without evaluating the effects on results. The procedures of field data acquisition, statistical analysis, and the test for the null hypothesis of complete spatial randomness are described and the presentation of results is discussed. Different methods of edge correction were tested on a computer-generated random pattern and a mapped distribution of a Mediterranean shrubland. The inclusion of buffer zones around mapped plots describes the spatial pattern most accurately, but may not warrant the additional labour involved. Three variations of the weighted edge correction yielded comparable results for the distribution patterns tested. The toroidal edge correction may give biased results for nonrandom patterns. Recommendations for standardisation of the statistical procedures and data presentation are given.},

abstract = {Baboons of the genus Papio have colonised wide areas of Africa and parts of the Arabian Peninsula. Traditionally, 5 phenotypically distinct morphotypes (species) are recognised: chacma baboons, yellow baboons, olive baboons, Guinea baboons and hamadryas baboons. We used mitochondrial DNA (“Brown” region) sequence data obtained mainly from faecal samples collected across the geographical range of baboons to reconstruct their phylogenetic relationships. Eight well-supported major haplogroups were detected, which reflect geographic populations. These disagree with the traditional classification of baboons into only 5 taxa. We found that West African olive and chacma baboons both comprise at least two deeply separated clades. In the case of chacma baboons, they correspond to recognised morphotypes (Cape chacma and grey-footed chacma). Our data also support a previously suggested distinction between yellow and Kinda baboons from central Zambia. Two other terminal clades from eastern Africa comprise either eastern olive and hamadryas baboons or eastern olive and yellow baboons. Southern yellow baboons cluster with grey-footed chacma baboons. Our data also indicate a possible mitochondrial overlap between Guinea baboons and a particular lineage of western olive baboons from Ivory Coast. These results support recent molecular studies, which detected several para- and polyphyletic mitochondrial clades in Papio, suggesting that the evolutionary history of baboons is even more complicated than previously thought. Thus, important roles might have been played by multiple phases of fragmentation, isolation, hybridisation, introgression, and nuclear swamping, hence, reticulation. These processes were most likely triggered by multiple cycles of expansion and retreat of savannah biomes during late Pliocene and Pleistocene glacial and inter-glacial periods. We also speculate on the likely dispersal pathways of these primates that may have led to their current distribution.},

abstract = {Trophic cascades are regarded as important signals for top-down control of food web dynamics. Although there is clear evidence supporting the existence of trophic cascades, the mechanisms driving this important dynamic are less clear. Trophic cascades could arise through direct population-level effects, in which predators prey on herbivores, thereby decreasing the abundance of herbivores that impact plant trophic levels. Trophic cascades could also arise through indirect behavioral-level effects, in which herbivore prey shift their foraging behavior in response to predation risk. Such behavioral shifts can result in reduced feeding time and increased starvation risk, again lowering the impact of herbivores on plants. We evaluated the relative importance of these two mechanisms, using field experiments in an old-field system composed of herbaceous plants, grasshopper herbivores, and spider predators. We created two treatments, Risk spiders that had their chelicerae glued, and Predation spiders that remained unmanipulated. We then systematically evaluated the impacts of these predator manipulations at behavioral, population, and food web scales in experimental mesocosms. At the behavioral level, grasshoppers did not distinguish between Risk spiders and Predation spiders. Grasshoppers exhibited significant shifts in feeding-time budget in the presence of spiders vs. when alone. At the grasshopper population level, Risk spider and Predation spider treatments caused the same level of grasshopper mortality, which was significantly higher than mortality in a control without spiders, indicating that the predation effects were compensatory to risk effects. At the food web level, Risk spider and Predation spider treatments decreased the impact grasshoppers had on grass biomass, supporting the existence of a trophic cascade. Moreover, Risk spider and Predation spider treatments produced statistically similar effects, again indicating that predation effects on trophic dynamics were compensatory to risk effects. We conclude that indirect effects resulting from antipredator behavior can produce trophic-level effects that are similar in form and strength to those generated by direct predation events.},

abstract = {A major challenge in carnivore conservation worldwide is identifying priority human–carnivore conflict sites where mitigation efforts would be most effective. Spatial predation risk modeling recently emerged as a tool for predicting and mapping hotspots of livestock depredation using locations where carnivores attacked livestock in the past. This literature review evaluates the approaches and applications of spatial risk modeling for reducing human–carnivore conflict and presents a workflow to help conservation practi- tioners use this tool. Over the past decade 18 studies were published, most which examined canid and felid (10 and 8 studies on each group, respectively) depredation on cattle (14) and sheep (12). Studies employed correlation modeling, spatial association and/or spatial interpolation to identify high-risk landscape features, and many (but not all) validated models with independent data. The landscape features associated with carnivore attacks related to the species (carnivore and prey), environment, human infrastructure and man- agement interventions. Risk maps from most studies (14) were used to help livestock owners and managers identify top-priority areas for implementing carnivore deterrents, with some efforts achieving[90 {\%} reductions in attacks. Only one study affected policy, highlighting a gap where risk maps could be useful for more clearly communicating information to assist policymakers with large-scale decisions on conflict. Studies were used to develop a six-step workflow on integrating risk modeling into conservation. This review reveals a need for future predation risk modeling to focus more on validating models, accounting for feedbacks and impacting conflict-related policy in order to reliably improve the mitigation of human–carnivore conflict globally.},

@article{Ginnett1995,
abstract = {1. In this paper we test a simple model of herbivore functional response. The model predicts a foraging animal's average dry-matter intake rate as a function of the mean bite size obtained within a small patch of forage. The model partitions a herbivore's per bite handling time into cropping and chewing parameters that are assumed to be independent of bite size. Cropping and chewing are assumed to be mutually exclusive activities. 2. To test the model, we fed captive giraffes hand-constructed patches of forage that varied in potential bite size and videotaped the giraffe's responses. This allowed us to estimate the mean bite sizes and intake rates achieved by the animals. We fitted the model to these data and compared parameter estimates from the regression fitting to observational estimates obtained by analysing the videotapes. We also tested the hypothesis that the parameters of the model were independent of bite size. 3. Although we found good statistical fit between model and data, regression-derived parameter estimates did not agree well with those obtained by observation. The model's parameters were significantly related to bite size. Although we could not test it explicitly, cropping and chewing appeared to overlap. We conclude that the model does not faithfully represent the actual foraging mechanism used by our experimental animals. 4. We propose a more flexible explanation of the functional response mechanism that partitions a herbivore's per bite handling time into fixed and incremental (per g) time costs. Both the fixed and incremental time costs may be the result of cropping and/or chewing.},

abstract = {The African lion Panthera leo, spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta and leopard Panthera pardus are all killed in retaliation for livestock predation, but each species suffers differently from these impacts due to differences in predatory behavior and cultural attitudes of pastoralists. Using detailed data on livestock predation in the Maasai steppe landscape in Northern Tanzania, I investigated how prey preference, location and timing of livestock attacks contributed to the vulnerability of lions, leopards and spotted hyenas to retaliatory killing. Lions mostly preyed upon adult cattle and donkeys. In contrast, hyenas and leopards primarily killed small stock (goat, sheep and calves) and dogs. Hyenas and leopards mostly attacked livestock at night, whereas lions often attacked grazing livestock during the daytime. These behaviors made lions the most vulnerable to direct retaliatory killing, although some villages specifically targeted hyenas with poison, and the cultural traditions of pastoralists also exacerbate the retaliatory killing of lions. I highlight the complex interactions of social (human) and ecological dimensions of livestock predation and retaliation against predators. Any conservation intervention should strive to address human-carnivore conflicts at the appropriate social scale.},

abstract = {Hypotheses for trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) decline in Rocky Mountain national parks include long-term high herbivory by elk (Cervus elaphus), decreased disturbance, climate change, and long-term low elk herbivory. Predation theory, as applied to herbivores, was used to describe alternative functional responses predicted by each hypothesis. Further, we postulated that elk behavioral patterns resulting from predation risk could also influence aspen herbivory. We tested predictions by sampling aspen density and browsing conditions in spatially separate watersheds in the Canadian Rockies, with three areas in each of three elk density levels ({\textless}2, 2-4, {\textgreater}4 elk/km2), and in each of four tree cover classes: recently disturbed ({\textless}25 years ago), and low, moderate, and high. Plot elk use was indexed with pellet group counts classed by habitat patch type, aspen condition (open or thicket), and different distances from trails or park boundaries used by predators, hunters, or park visitors. The herbivory rate on aspen saplings ({\textgreater}1 m height and {\textless}1 cm diameter at breast height, DBH) fitted the predictions of a Type 2 functional response (e.g. increased rate of herbivory with decreased sapling density). The Type 2 response appeared to result from low elk use in dense aspen thickets when predation risk is high. An interaction effect in the tree cover x elk density factorial analysis indicated that recent disturbances ({\textless}25 years) have incrementally increased the number of aspen saplings, but did not cause a major shift to an abundant sapling state in areas of high and moderate elk density. These results best supported the predictions of the low elk herbivory hypothesis. Anthropogenic burning combined with human and carnivore predation effects on elk (behavioral and numeric) appeared to be important in aspen's long-term persistence, and its recent decline.

abstract = {Fostering local community tolerance for endangered carnivores, such as tigers (Panthera tigris), is a core component ofmany conservation strategies. Identification of antecedents of tolerance will facilitate the development of effective tolerance-building conservation action and secure local community support for, and involvement in, conservation initiatives.We use a stated preference approach for measuring tolerance, based on the ‘Wildlife Stake- holder Acceptance Capacity' concept, to explore villagers' tolerance levels for tigers in the Bangladesh Sundarbans, an area where, at the time of the research, human-tiger conflict was severe. We apply structural equation modeling to test an a priori defined theoretical model of tolerance and identify the experiential and psychological basis of tolerance in this community. Our results indicate that beliefs about tigers and about the perceived current tiger population trend are predictors of tolerance for tigers. Positive beliefs about tigers and a belief that the tiger population is not currently increasing are both associated with greater stated tolerance for the species. Contrary to commonly-held notions, negative experiences with tigers do not directly affect tolerance levels; instead, their effect is mediated by villag- ers' beliefs about tigers and risk perceptions concerning human-tiger conflict incidents. These findings highlight a need to explore and understand the socio-psychological factors that encourage tolerance towards endangered species. Our research also demonstrates the applicability of this approach to tolerance research to a wide range of socio-economic and cultural contexts and reveals its capacity to enhance carnivore conservation efforts worldwide.},

abstract = {Analysis of the spatial distribution patterns of five populations of the recently discovered montane unicorn (Monoceros montanus) yield several surprising results. Principal among these is the fact that when censused using a grid of 1 km2 quadrats all populations yielded a variance:mean ratio of 1.0, though each population showed a different pattern of aggregation and none correponded to a Poisson distribution. Distributions with these mathematical properties are termed unicornian. It is demonstrated that the variance:mean ratio is useless as a measure of departure from randomness, though it is widely recommended as such. The ratio is also uninterpretable as a measure of aggregation except for its coincidental relationship to indices such as the Morisita index of aggregation (IM). IM can be defined in terms of the probability of two randomly selected individuals being found in the same quadrat or sampling unit. It can be generalized to yield a family of indices, IMr, relating to the probability of r randomly selected individuals being found in the same sampling unit. Presentation of a plot of IMJ versus r may often be preferable to condensation of all information on aggregation into a single value, such as IM. Comment is also offered on the need to consider a range of spatial scales, on the corresponding definitional and scale aspects of plotless sampling, and on the fruitlessness of attempting to view spatial patterns themselves as consisting of only two distinct aspects, such as intensity and grain},

abstract = {We quantified livestock (cattle, shoats, horses and donkeys) losses to lions (Panthera leo) and attitudes to lions, livestock losses and tourism among livestock owners, village residents and tourism workers around Makgadikgadi Pans National Park in Botswana. Losses were not correlated with the size or structure of livestock enclosures, numbers of dogs or herders. Rather losses increased with the amount of livestock owned. Most were stray animals preyed upon at night. Attitudes to wildlife, conservation and lions were also not consistently distributed within the society we studied. Negative attitudes to lions were almost ubiquitous among cattleposts but less widespread among people living in the more urbanized society of villages or among people working in tourism. Although four tourist camps were operating in the area, benefits from these operations were largely limited to employees. Despite considerable sums of money being paid to Botswana by local tourist facilities few respondents viewed tourism as valuable and most felt that the government and not they or their community was the main beneficiary of tourism. Tourism employees made up a small sub-section of the adult population drawn predominately from larger villages while the costs of livestock losses were spread among cattleposts near the park boundary. These same cattlepost respondents were not prepared to improve stock care to protect livestock, but indicated a willingness to kill lions instead. If tourism is to play a role in reducing human-wildlife conflict, communities must not be regarded as homogenous entities into which to distribute benefits evenly. Benefits might usefully be distributed in relation to the costs of coexisting with wildlife or used as incentives to better protect livestock or other human resources. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Hypotheses for trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) decline in Rocky Mountain national parks include long-term high herbivory by elk (Cervus elaphus), decreased disturbance, climate change, and long-term low elk herbivory. Predation theory, as applied to herbivores, was used to describe alternative functional responses predicted by each hypothesis. Further, we postulated that elk behavioral patterns resulting from predation risk could also influence aspen herbivory. We tested predictions by sampling aspen density and browsing conditions in spatially separate watersheds in the Canadian Rockies, with three areas in each of three elk density levels ({\textless}2, 2-4, {\textgreater}4 elk/km2), and in each of four tree cover classes: recently disturbed ({\textless}25 years ago), and low, moderate, and high. Plot elk use was indexed with pellet group counts classed by habitat patch type, aspen condition (open or thicket), and different distances from trails or park boundaries used by predators, hunters, or park visitors. The herbivory rate on aspen saplings ({\textgreater}1 m height and {\textless}1 cm diameter at breast height, DBH) fitted the predictions of a Type 2 functional response (e.g. increased rate of herbivory with decreased sapling density). The Type 2 response appeared to result from low elk use in dense aspen thickets when predation risk is high. An interaction effect in the tree cover x elk density factorial analysis indicated that recent disturbances ({\textless}25 years) have incrementally increased the number of aspen saplings, but did not cause a major shift to an abundant sapling state in areas of high and moderate elk density. These results best supported the predictions of the low elk herbivory hypothesis. Anthropogenic burning combined with human and carnivore predation effects on elk (behavioral and numeric) appeared to be important in aspen's long-term persistence, and its recent decline.

abstract = {An alternate model for rumor spreading over networks is suggested, in which two rumors (termed rumor 1 and rumor 2) with different probabilities of acceptance may propagate among nodes. The propagation is not symmetric in the sense that when deciding which rumor to adopt, nodes always consider rumor 1 first. The model is a natural generalization of the well-known epidemic SIS (susceptible-infective-susceptible) model and reduces to it when some of the parameters of this model are zero. We find that preferred rumor 1 is dominant in the network when the degree of nodes is high enough and/or when the network contains large clustered groups of nodes, expelling rumor 2. However, numerical simulations on synthetic networks show that it is possible for rumor 2 to occupy a nonzero fraction of the nodes in many cases as well. Specifically, in the Watts-Strogatz small-world model a moderate level of clustering supports its adoption, while increasing randomness reduces it. For Erdos-Renyi networks, a low average degree allows the coexistence of the two types of rumors. In Barabasi-Albert networks generated with a low m , where m is the number of links when a new node is added, it is also possible for rumor 2 to spread over the network.},

abstract = {Negotiating the complexities of wildlife management increasingly requires new approaches, especially where data may be limited. A robust combination of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and western science has the potential to improve management decisions and enhance the validity of ecological inferences. We examined the strengths and weaknesses of predicting woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) habitat selection with resource selection functions (RSF) based on western science and TEK-based models within the territory of the Taku River Tlingit First Nation of northern British Columbia. We developed seasonal RSF models with data from 10 global positioning system collared caribou. We generated TEK-based habitat suitability index models from interviews with Taku River Tlingit members. We tested the ability of both habitat models to spatially predict the occurrence of collared caribou locations. To portray differences between the models, we statistically and visually compared the spatial predictions of TEK and RSF modeling approaches using Kappa statistics and k-fold cross validation. Kappa statistics of habitat ranks from the models showed substantial agreement during summer (K¼0.649) and fair agreement during winter (K¼0.337). We found that both TEK and RSF models predicted independent caribou locations (Spearman's rank correlations from k-fold cross-validation ranged from 0.612 to 0.997). Differences inmodel performance were a result of RSF models predicting more relatively high quality habitat than TEK models. Given the widespread declines of woodland caribou across the boreal forest of Canada, and the requirement of the Canadian Species at Risk Act to incorporate both traditional and western science approaches into recovery planning, our results demonstrate that TEK-based habitat models can effectively inform recovery planning for this imperiled species.},

abstract = {1. The role of lion Panthera leo predation in the dynamics of blue wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus and zebra Equus burchelli populations was investigated through simulation models. The data used in the models were from intensive observations over 4 years in the south-east of the Kruger National Park. 2. Population estimates of wildebeest and zebra were made from aerial surveys, sex and age ratios from ground counts. Lion numbers were determined from obser- vations of marked and radio-collared animals. Predation was studied by following lions for continuous periods of up to 336 h. 3. Two models were constructed. Model 1 ascertained the number of killing lions (adult females) that could be supported by each prey population while remaining stable. A single model was constructed for the sedentary wildebeest population. A summer and winter model was constructed for the semi-migratory zebra population. The sensitivity of the parameters in the model was tested by changing their value by 10{\%}. In model 2, the kill age structure for each species was changed to determine the number of killing lions the altered prey selection parameters could support. 4. There was no difference in the vulnerability of either species to predation. Zebra foals ({\textless}1 year) were killed more frequently than expected. No selection for sex or by season could be found for either species. 5. Model 1 predicted that the wildebeest population stabilizes with 7-7 killing lions, close to the number in the study area. The winter zebra population stabilizes with 6-8 killing lions and the summer zebra population with 19 4. Manipulation of kill rate followed by adult fecundity rate had the greatest effect on population size of both species. In model 2, wildebeest predation was made selective towards calves and zebra predation was made non-selective for sex and age. With these parameters the wildebeest population stabilizes with 10 7 killing lions and the zebra population with 5*4 in winter and 151 in summer. 6. The models suggest that lion predation affected wildebeest more severely than zebra during the study. This was through the way in which lions selected their prey, and because of the sedentary behaviour of the wildebeest, as opposed to the semi- migratory behaviour of the zebra.},

First, we investigate the age-independent case and introduce four models, which are classified according to whether the population is closed or not and whether the rumor is constant or variable. After formulating the models as finite-dimensional ODE systems, we show that the solutions converge to an equilibrium as t ??? ???. Next, we investigate a model for the transmission of a constant rumor in an age-structured population with age-dependent transmission coefficients. We formulate the model as an abstract Cauchy problem on an infinite-dimensional Banach space and show the existence and uniqueness of solutions. Then, under some appropriate assumptions, we examine the existence of its nontrivial equilibria and the stability of its trivial equilibrium. We show that the spectral radius R0 {\{}colon equals{\}} r (over(T, ??)) for some positive operator over(T, ??) is the threshold. We also show sufficient conditions for the local stability of the nontrivial equilibria. Finally, we show that the model is uniformly strongly persistent if R0 {\textgreater} 1. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We present a study from Katavi National Park and surrounding areas that assessed the size and structure of the lion population as a baseline for wildlife management. We assessed lion and prey species density directly by sample surveys that incorporated specific detection probabilities. By using three prey-biomass regression models we also indirectly estimated lion density based on the assumption that these indirect estimates represent the Park's carrying capacity for lions. To identify key factors influencing lion abundance we conducted Spearman Rank correlation and logistic regression analyses, using prey species abundance and distance to Park boundary as explanatory variables. The mean size of the lion population was 31{\&}{\#}8211;45{\%} of the estimated carrying capacity, with considerably fewer subadult males observed than expected. Lions generally avoided areas of up to 3 km from the Park boundary and were not observed outside the Park. Abundance of common prey species was significantly correlated with distance to the Park boundary and lion abundance. Lion abundance was most strongly associated with waterbuck abundance/presence. Based on observed lion demography, an evaluation of hunting quotas in adjacent hunting blocks, and anecdotal information on traditional lion hunting, we hypothesize that anthropogenic mortality of lions outside Katavi National Park is affecting lion abundance within the Park. Our results suggest that estimating lion densities with prey-biomass regression models overestimates densities even inside protected areas if these areas are subject to natural and anthropogenic edge effects.},

abstract = {Social media forms a central domain for the production and dissemination of real-time information. Even though such flows of information have traditionally been thought of as diffusion processes over social networks, the underlying phenomena are the result of a complex web of interactions among numerous participants. Here we develop the Linear Influence Model where rather than requiring the knowledge of the social network and then modeling the diffusion by predicting which node will influence which other nodes in the network, we focus on modeling the global influence of a node on the rate of diffusion through the (implicit) network. We model the number of newly infected nodes as a function of which other nodes got infected in the past. For each node we estimate an influence function that quantifies how many subsequent infections can be attributed to the influence of that node over time. A nonparametric formulation of the model leads to a simple least squares problem that can be solved on large datasets. We validate our model on a set of 500 million tweets and a set of 170 million news articles and blog posts. We show that the Linear Influence Model accurately models influences of nodes and reliably predicts the temporal dynamics of information diffusion. We find that patterns of influence of individual participants differ significantly depending on the type of the node and the topic of the information.},

abstract = {Many large carnivore populations are under threat from persecution for killing livestock. Our ability to deal with this threat is limited by our understanding of the aspects of the ecology of large carnivores and the socio-economics of humans relevant to livestock predation. This study adds new evidence to debates surrounding lion ecology, home-range analysis and human-large carnivore conflict mitigation. I use novel methods and try to span the divide between human sciences and ecology to create a holistic view of a conflict and make recommendations based on both ecology and socio-economics. I used variation in the availability of migratory wild prey as a natural experiment to investigate the feeding and spatial ecology of lions. I demonstrate a link between rises in wild prey abundance and declines in the frequency of livestock predation per unit abundance that supports claims that wild prey can buffer people against livestock losses. Changes in livestock predation frequency were not passive responses to changes in prey abundance and stock-raiding lions changed their movements to increase livestock encounter rates although rarely seemed to attack livestock at cattleposts. Instead they spent most time in areas where livestock grazed untended and in which they strayed at night suggesting that, at least in the Makgadikgadi that herding vigilance may be at least as important as static defences (such as reinforced livestock enclosures) at reducing livestock losses. Livestock predation appeared to allow stock-raiders to use smaller home-ranges than other lions which became smaller yet when wild prey was least abundant. People attitudes towards lions and wildlife seemed to reflect a mismatch between revenue and livestock predation distributions in the community. Most benefits accrued to employees while losses accrued to livestock owners and I argue that treating wages as a community benefit is perhaps unwise. Investments in prevention were minimal among livestock owners who blamed the government for the conflict thereby negating their responsibility. However, there were promising signs that joint government/community investment in preventions would be welcomed. In developing the spatial analyses I tested the performance kernel home-range estimation using data from GPS-collars. The results suggest that the preferred implementation of this method is subject to considerable limitations of accuracy and stability and that computer simulated data lacks important similarities with animal movement data. The changes in home-range sizes of stock raiding lions prompted me to re-address previous analysis relating lion social and spatial ecology to prey abundance by trying to incorporate several new studies and the concept of resource dispersion. My analysis, while not conclusive does hint that resource dispersion may play a role in regulating lion social ecology that merits further study.},

abstract = {1. Demography and conservation status of many wild organisms are increasingly shaped by interactions with humans. This is particularly the case for large, wide-ranging carnivores. 2. Using 206 mortality records (1999–2012) of lions in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, we calculated mortality rates for each source of anthropogenic mortality, modelled risk of anthropogenic mortality across the landscape accounting for time lions spent in different parts of the landscape, and assessed whether subsets of the population were more at risk. 3. Anthropogenic activities caused 88{\%} of male and 67{\%} of female mortalities; male mortal-ity being dominated by trophy hunting while the sources for female mortality were more varied (bycatch snaring, retaliatory killing, hunting). 4. Landscapes of anthropogenic mortality risk revealed that communal subsistence farming areas, characterized by high risk (due to retaliatory killing) but avoided by lions, are popula-tion sinks. Trophy hunting areas and areas within protected areas bordering communal farm-land, where bushmeat snaring is prevalent, form 'ecological traps' (or 'attractive sinks'). 5. Lions avoided risky areas, suggesting they may make behavioural decisions based on per-ceptions of risk. Experienced adults used risky areas less and incorporated lower proportions of them in their home ranges than young individuals, suggesting that the latter may either be na€ ıve or forced into peripheral habitats. 6. Synthesis and applications. This paper contributes to an understanding of how large carni-vore populations are affected by anthropogenic mortality across the conservation landscape. This is critical to designing focussed, appropriate and cost-effective conservation management strategies. Agricultural areas are intuitively identified by conservationists as being risky for car-nivores due to retaliatory killing, with threats largely mitigated against by improving livestock protection. However, parts of protected areas may also form less easily identified 'attractive sinks' for carnivores. In particular, trophy hunting areas adjacent to national parks need careful management to avoid damaging effects of overhunting. Law enforcement is needed to reduce the effects of bushmeat poaching on predators and other wildlife in protected areas. To be most effective, resource-limited antipoaching activities should prioritize wildlife-rich areas close to human settlement as these tend to be hot spots for bushmeat poaching.},

abstract = {Management and conservation of populations of animals requires information on where they are, why they are there, and where else they could be. These objectives are typically approached by collecting data on the animals' use of space, relating these positional data to prevailing environmental conditions and employing the resulting statistical models to predict usage at other geographical regions. Technical advances in wildlife telemetry have accomplished manifold increases in the amount and quality of available data, creating the need for a statistical framework that can use them to make population-level inferences for habitat preference and space-use. This has been slow-in-coming because wildlife telemetry data are spatio-temporally autocorrelated, often unbalanced, presence-only observations of behaviourally complex animals, responding to a multitude of cross-correlated environmental variables. We review the evolution of regression models for the analysis of space-use and habitat preference and outline the essential features of a framework that emerges naturally from these foundations. This allows us to derive a relationship between usage of points in geographical space and preference of habitats in environmental space. Within this framework, we discuss eight challenges, inherent in the spatial analysis of telemetry data and, for each, we propose solutions that can work in tandem. Specifically, we propose a logistic, mixed-effects approach that uses generalized additive transformations of the environmental covariates and is fitted to a response data-set comprising the telemetry and simulated observations, under a case-control design. We apply this framework to a non-trivial case-study using satellite-tagged grey seals Halichoerus grypus from the east coast of Scotland. We perform model selection by cross-validation and confront our final model's predictions with telemetry data from the same, as well as different, geographical regions. We conclude that, despite the complex behaviour of the study species, flexible empirical models can capture the environmental relationships that shape population distributions.},

Three oesophageally fistulated steers grazed homogeneous, hand-constructed swards of Paspalum dilatatum Poir. or Medicago sativa L., in a sward area of approximately 0.36 m2, for 60-212 s. Three types of jaw movements (JM) were distinguished: manipulative JM that gather herbage into the mouth, chewing JM, and compound JM that manipulate fresh herbage and chew herbage already in the mouth within one cycle of opening and closing of the jaws. Intake rate (I, g min-1) was a discontinuous asymptotic function of W: I = W max(0.0337,0.0201 + 0.0095*W). Sward height and bulk density did not significantly affect I beyond the effects of W. Time per bite was 2.0 s when W ??? 1.29 g, and increased linearly with W when W{\textgreater}1.29 g. Linear regression of time per bite on total number of JM explained 96{\%} of the variance. A non-linear relation between total JM per bite and W comprised a linear relation between total chews per bite and W, and a constant number of total manipulative JM per bite. When W increased up to c. 1.5 g, chewing requirements were met by compound JM. Above W of 1.5 g, the overlap of chewing and manipulation reached a maximum, so total JM increased with W. The importance of compound JM and the potential for overlap between chewing and searching are discussed in the context of foraging models. ?? 1994.},

A study examining the suitability of green manuring as a technology for use with wet season tomato producers in Ghana is described. Findings from this case study demonstrate that Participatory Budgeting can be used by farmers and researchers to analyse current cultivation practices, identify the options for including green manures into the system and explore the direct and wider resource implications of the technology. Scored Causal Diagrams can be used to identify farmers' perceptions of the relative importance of the problem that the technology seeks to address. The use of the methods in this ex-ante evaluation process appears to have the potential to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the adaptive research process. This ensures that technologies subsequently examined in trials are relevant to farmers' interests, existing systems and resources, thereby increasing the chances of farmer adoption. It is concluded that this process has potential for use with other technologies and in other farming systems. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Changing land use patterns in southern Africa have potential to dramatically alter the prospects for carnivore conservation. Understanding these influences is essential for conservation planning. We interviewed 250 ranchers in Namibia to assess human tolerance towards and the distribution of large carnivores. Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), leopards (Panthera pardus) and brown hyaenas (Hyaena brunnea) were widely distributed on Namibian farmlands, spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) had a narrower distribution, and wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) and lions (Panthera leo) are largely limited to areas near source populations. Farmers were most tolerant of leopards and least tolerant of lions, wild dogs and spotted hyaenas. Several factors relating to land use correlated consistently with carnivore-presence and landowner tolerance. Carnivores were more commonly present and/or tolerated where; wildlife diversity and biomass were higher; income from wildlife was higher; income from livestock was lower; livestock biomass was lower; in conservancies; game fencing was absent; and financial losses from livestock depredation were lower. Efforts to create conditions whereby the costs associated with carnivores are lowest, and which confer financial value to them are likely to be the most effective means of promoting carnivore conservation. Such conditions are achieved where land owners pool land to create conservancies where livestock are replaced with wildlife (or where livestock husbandry is improved) and where wildlife generates a significant proportion of ranch income. Additional measures, such as promoting improved livestock husbandry and educational outreach efforts may also help achieve coexistence with carnivores. Our findings provide insights into conditions more conducive to the persistence of and tolerance towards large carnivores might be increased on private (and even communal) lands in Namibia, elsewhere in southern and East Africa and other parts of the world where carnivore conservation is being attempted on private lands.},

abstract = {Spring migration may facilitate survival and recruitment in mammals by reducing predation risk and increasing access to higher-quality forage. The Yellowstone pronghorn Antilocapra americana population ({\textless}250 animals) retains one of only two pronghorn migrations remaining in the greater Yellowstone region of the western United States. We used 5743 telemetry locations of 44 adult, female pronghorn during June 1999-August 2005 to determine migration patterns, seasonal distributions, and individual fidelity to migratory strategies. Yellowstone pronghorn were partially migratory, with {\textgreater}70{\%} of the pronghorn population migrating 15-50 km to 4 contiguous summering areas and {\textless}30{\%} remaining year-round on the winter range. Most radio-collared pronghorn showed fidelity across years to their migration strategy and summer use area, but approximately 20{\%} migrated in some years, but not others. This behavioral flexibility is consistent with the hypothesis that migration in Yellowstone pronghorn is a conditional strategy and likely contributed to dynamic and rapid changes in the proportion of migrants from 80{\%} to 20{\%} and back to 70{\%} during 1967-2005. All migrant pronghorn traveled 10 km over a topographic bottleneck (Mt. Everts) separating the winter and summer ranges, primarily using grassland-sagebrush pathways through conifer forest. We recommend continued protection of this corridor because increased mortality and a decreasing proportion of migrants may be as important a threat to the persistence of partially migratory populations as habitat fragmentation, especially when local resources for non-migrants are inadequate to sustain the entire population. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Approximately 70{\%} of farmers interviewed are wholly dependent on agriculture for their subsistence, either as farmers and/or as seasonal agricultural labourers. Farmers consider crop-raiding by wild animals, particularly baboons and pigs, to be a major source of crop losses. Susceptibility to crop-raiding is influenced by a number of factors including proximity of fields to forest boundary and types of crops grown. The farmers' expressed fear of baboons and pigs may truly reflect the scale of damage these animals can cause, or it may be influenced by baboons' and pigs' perceived ability to harm or even kill humans.},

abstract = {African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) predation was observed in Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania, between September, 1964, and July, 1965, when packs were in residence. The original pack of 21 dogs remained only 4 months, but 7 and then 6 members of the group reappeared in the Crater at irregular intervals. The ratio of males:females was disproportionately high, and the single bitch in the small pack had a litter of 9 in which there was only one female. The pack functions primarily as a hunting unit, cooperating closely in killing and mutual defense, subordinating individual to group activity, with strong discipline during the chase and unusually amicable relations between members. A regular leader se- lected and ran down the prey, but there was no other sign of a rank hierarchy. Fights are very rare. A Greeting ceremony based on infantile begging functions to promote pack harmony, and appeasement behavior substitutes for aggression when dogs are competing over meat. Wild dogs hunt primarily by sight and by daylight. The pack often approaches herds of prey within several hundred yards, but the particular quarry is selected only after the chase begins. They do not run in relays as commonly sup- posed. The leader can overtake the fleetest game usually within 2 miles. While the others lag behind, one or two dogs maintain intervals of 100 yards or more behind the leader, in positions to intercept the quarry if it circles or begins to dodge. As soon as small prey is caught, the pack pulls it apart; large game is worried from the rear until it falls from exhaustion and shock. Of 50 kills observed, Thomson's gazelles (Gazella thomsonii) made up 54 percent, newborn and juvenile wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) 36 percent, Grant's gazelles (Gazella granti) 8 percent, and kongoni (Alcelaphus buselaphus cokei) 2 percent. The dogs hunted regularly in early morning and late afternoon, with a success rate per chase of over 85 percent and a mean time of only 25 minutes between starting an activity cycle to capturing prey. Both large and small packs generally killed in each hunting cycle, so large packs make more efficient use of their prey resource. Reactions of prey species depend on the behavior of the wild dogs, and disturbance to game was far less than has been represented. Adult wildebeest and zebra (Equus burchelli) showed little fear of the dogs. Territorial male Thomson's gazelles, which made up 67 percent of the kills of this species, and females with concealed fawns, were most vulnerable. The spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) is a serious competitor capable of driving small packs from their kills. A minimum of 4-6 dogs is needed to function effectively as a pack. It is concluded that the wild dog is not the most wantonly destructive and disruptive African predator, that it is an interesting, valuable species now possibly endangered, and should be strictly protected, particularly where the small and medium-sized antelopes have increased at an alarming rate.

abstract = {An agent-based model (ABM) representing snare trapping of blue duikers (Cephalophus monticola) was co-designed and used with local populations to raise their awareness about the sustainability of bushmeat hunting activities in the region of the Korup National Park (South-West Cameroon). Village meetings based on interactive simulations with a stylized scale model were structured in three successive steps. During the first step, an abstract representation of a village surrounded by a portion of forest was co-designed by directly manipulating the computer interface displaying a spatial grid. Then, knowledge about the live-cycle traits and the behavior of blue duikers was shared through the demonstration of the individual-based population dynamics module of the ABM. The objective of the second step, introducing the hunting module of the ABM, was to elicit snare trapping practices trough interactive simulation and to calibrate the hunting module by setting a value for the probability of a blue duiker to be caught by a snare trap. In a third step, a more realistic version of the ABM was introduced. The seven villages included in the process were located in the GIS-based spatial representation, and the number of {\&}ldquo;Hunter{\&}rdquo; agents for each village in the ABM was set according to the results of a survey. The demonstration of this realistic version triggered discussion about possible management scenarios, whose results obtained with the finalized version of the ABM will be discussed during next round of village meetings. We present the pros and cons of the method consisting in using at an early stage of the process interactive simulations with stylized scale models to specify empirically-based agent-based models.},

abstract = {Many approaches to conserving and managing natural resources depend upon rules, but the existence of rules alone does not guarantee compliance. Information on rule breaking behaviour is needed for designing interventions to improve compliance. However, directly investigating rule breaking is difficult as perpetrators may not wish to identify themselves. Other disciplines have developed methods for answering sensitive questions but so far these have not been widely applied in conservation. Using rule breaking among fly fishers as a case study, we tested two methods specifically designed for collecting sensitive data (the randomised response technique (RRT) and the nominative technique), against a conventional self-complete questionnaire. RRT resulted in much higher estimates of the prevalence of rule breaking than the self-complete questionnaire, particularly for more sensitive questions. The nominative technique yielded extremely low estimates, possibly because respondents did not know enough about their friends' rule breaking behaviour, or did not want to discuss it in a face-to-face interview. Despite requiring large sample sizes we suggest that RRT is a useful method for obtaining information about rule breaking and could be more widely used, for example in studies of poaching and illegal resource extraction. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The outcome of many high-order processes in ecology depends on the way in which the abundance and distribution of plants affect the eating rate of mammalian herbivores. However, simple, mechanistic models describing the operation of the functional response of these animals have failed to emerge. We offer new models describing the effects of spatial and morphological characteristics of plants on the intake rate of plant tissue by mammalian herbivores feeding within plant patches. We structure our models to respond to three patterns of plant availability: (1) spatially dispersed, apparent plants; (2) spatially dispersed, nonapparent plants; and (3) spatially concentrated plants. We depart from the traditional representations of predator functional response in assuming that searching for food and processing it can overlap in time. Our models illustrate that several distinct mechanisms can account for Type II functional responses frequently seen in herbivores. We show how differences among these mechanisms can explain anomalies in the empirical literature on regulation of intake rate of mammalian herbivores including divergence in functional responses between grazers and browsers, linear functional response curves, and curves showing zero slope throughout the domain of food availability.},

abstract = {This paper outlines some of the main issues and debates in participatory research and participatory technology development, concentrating on implementation. Arguments in favour of farmer participatory research (FPR) are examined, as are a number of difficulties. An important question is the extent to which the findings generated by location-specific, participatory research are applicable and transferable to similar systems elsewhere. Issues of data analysis and use of statistics in participatory research are discussed. Modern statistical methods have a useful role in participatory research, but knowledge of these is limited due to the lack of suitable texts and, until recently, the lack of easily accessible computer software. Assessing the effectiveness of participatory ‘methods' is difficult as they are context sensitive. The resources needed for collaborative participatory work are often underestimated and methodologies for monitoring and evaluation have been particularly weak. The development of linkages between participatory research projects and national research organisations is not straightforward, and does not always lead to the institutionalisation of participatory approaches. Integration of participatory methods into differing institutional contexts requires management innovation, skill development and new working procedures. Critical areas are: building institutional linkages, maintaining communication, and co-ordination and management and monitoring of participatory research. Significant increases in devolved participatory research approaches are unlikely in the absence of strong farmers' organisations and intermediary organisations. A number of suggestions for further research are made.},

decades, several threats continue to cause species declines and even extinctions. Resource use by a growing human
population is a significant driver of biodiversity loss, so conservation scientists need to be interested in the factors that motivate human behaviour. Economic models have been applied to human decision making for many years; however, humans are not financially rational beings and other characteristics of the decision maker (including attitude) and the pressure that people perceive to behave in a certain way (subjective norms) may influence decision making; these are characteristics considered by social psychologists interested in human decision making.Wereview social-psychology theories of behaviour and how they have been used in the context of conservation and natural-resource management.Many studies focus on general attitudes towards conservation rather than attitudes towards specific behaviours of relevance to conservation and thus have limited value in designing interventions to change specific behaviours (e.g. reduce hunting of a threatened species). By more specifically defining the behaviour of interest, and investigating attitude in the context of other social-psychological predictors of behaviour (e.g. subjective norms, the presence of facilitating factors and moral obligation), behaviours that have an impact on conservation goals will be better understood, allowing for the improved design of interventions to influence them.},

But ambitious plans to extend wildlife corridors beyond protected areas must consider the economic and political implications when wildlife forage on crops, attack livestock, or otherwise threaten human security. Tradi- tionally, humans respond by killing “problem” wildlife and transforming wild habitats to prevent further losses. This traditional response, however, is now illegal or socially unacceptable in many areas, changing a simple competitive relationship between peo- ple and wildlife into a political conflict. Here we draw from experience in Bolivia, Uganda, and Wisconsin to outline a strategy for mitigating human–wildlife conflict based on participatory methods and co-management with twin objectives of wildlife conservation and safeguarding human security. Incorporating local stakeholders as partners in planning and implementation can help to win space for wildlife beyond protected area boundaries. We also show why systematic study of local people's per- ceptions of risk and participant planning of interventions are irreplaceable compo- nents of such projects.},

abstract = {Human-carnivore conflict is considered to be a major conservation and rural livelihood issue because many carnivore species have been heavily persecuted due to elevated conflict levels with communities. To mitigate such conflicts requires a firm understanding of their underlying patterns. This situation is epitomized in Pakistan, where carnivore populations have been greatly reduced, but where no research has investigated the conflict patterns of large carnivore guilds with humans. Focusing in and around Machiara National Park (MNP), Azad Jammu and Kashmir region, we conducted the first such scientific study in Pakistan. From January 2004 to May 2007, 148 people lost their livestock to four carnivore species. Leopard was responsible for the majority (90.6{\%}) of the 363 livestock killed, mainly goats (57.3{\%}) and sheep (27.8{\%}). Information-theoretic evaluation of a candidate set of regression models found that leopard kills inside villages were significantly higher for areas without electricity, while leopard kills outside villages were higher for pastoralists with larger herds that were further from MNP, with no effect from several guarding strategies used. Temporal leopard attacks were significantly and positively related to temperature, but not to rainfall, for goat kills, but not for other livestock kills. While leopard kills caused the greatest overall financial loss (19.8{\%}) amongst carnivores, which negatively affected local tolerance towards leopard, disease caused greater livestock losses (72.7{\%}). To improve both large carnivore and local livelihood prospects around MNP and across rural Pakistan, conservation and development projects should install village electricity supplies and vaccinate livestock, while the cost-effectiveness of different conflict mitigation strategies should be trialed.

abstract = {We analysed 38 years of data on 46 lion prides in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, and found that territorial competition directly affected critical components of female fitness and that larger prides gained and maintained access to the highest-quality habitat. Neighbours had a significant negative effect on female reproductive success and survival, and larger prides were significantly more likely to maintain control of disputed areas and to improve the quality of their territories. Adult females were significantly less likely to be alone when a pride had more neighbours, suggesting sensitivity to risk of encounter. In most cases, the effects of intergroup territorial competition were associated only with prides that had not recently split (i.e. that were not closely related). Overall, males were more important in group-territorial competition than expected, and female mortality and wounding rates were significantly associated with male neighbours, suggesting that males may use lethal aggression to tip the balance of power in favour of their prides. Within the Felidae, only lions are consistently gregarious, and our research illustrates that numerical advantage in territorial competition is a primary benefit of group living in lions and may have been important in the evolution of lion sociality. ?? 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Predators are critical components of ecosystems. Globally, conservation efforts have targeted depleted populations of top predators for legal protection, and in many cases, this protection has helped their recoveries. Where the recovery of individual species is the goal, these efforts can be seen as largely successful. From an ecosystem perspective, however, predator recovery can introduce significant new conservation and legal challenges. We highlight three types of conflicts created by a single-species focus: (1) recovering predator populations that increase competition with humans for the same prey, (2) new tradeoffs that emerge when protected predators consume protected prey, and (3) multiple predator populations that compete for the same limited prey. We use two food webs with parallel conservation challenges, the Northeast Pacific Ocean and the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem, to demonstrate legal/policy conflicts and the policy levers that exist to ameliorate conflicts. In some cases, scientific uncertainty about the ecological interaction hinders progress towards resolving conflicts. In others, available policy options are insufficient. In all cases, management decisions must be made in the face of an unknown future. We suggest a framework that incorporates multispecies science, policy tools, and tradeoff analyses into management.},

abstract = {A simulation model is used to quantify relationships between diet quality, digestive processes and body weight in ungulate herbivores. Retention time of food in the digestive tract is shown by regression to scale with W {\~{}} and to be longer in ruminants than in hindgut fermenters. Allometric relationships between whole gut mean retention time (MRT, h) and weight (W) were: MRT = 9.4 W {\~{}} (r 2 = 0.80) for hindgut fermenters and MRT= 15.3 W {\~{}} (r2=0.76) in ruminants. Longer retention of ingesta by large-bodied ruminants and hindgut fermenters increases digestive efficiency relative to small animals and permits them to survive on lower-quality foods. Compared with ruminants, hindgut fermenters' faster throughput is an advantage which outweighs their lower digestive efficiency, particularly on poor quality foods, provided that food resources are not limiting. This suggests that the predominance of ruminants in the middle range of body weights results from their more efficient use of scarce resources under conditions of resource depletion. Considering only physical limitations on intake, the model shows that the allometric coefficient which scales energy intake to body mass is 0.88 in ruminants and 0.82 in hindgut fermenters. The advantages of large body size are countered by disadvantages where food quantity is limited, and we suggest that the upper limit to ungulate body size is determined by the ability to extract nutrients from feeding niches during the nadir of the seasonal cycle of resource quality and abundance.},

In this paper, we model and examine the spread of information through personal conversations in a simulated socio-technical network that provides a high degree of realism and a great deal of captured detail. To our knowledge thisis the first time information spread via conversation has been modeled against a statistically accurate simulation of people's daily interactions within a specific urban or rural environment, capturing the points in time and space at which two people could converse, and providing a realistic basis formodeling human behavior during face-to-face interaction. We use a probabilistic model to decide whether two people will converse about a particular topic based on their similarity and familiarity. Similarity is modeled by matching selected demographic characteristics, while familiarity is modeled by the amount of contact required to convey information. We report our findings on the effects of familiarity and similarity on the spread of information over the social network. We resolve the results by age group, daily activities, time, household income, household size and examine the relative effect of these factors.For informal topics where little familiarity is required, shopping and recreational activities predominate; otherwise, home, work, and school predominate. We find that youths play a significant role in spreading information through a community rapidly, mainly through interactions in schools and recreational activities.},

abstract = {When Bluetongue Virus Serotype 8 (BTV-8) was first detected in Northern Europe in 2006, several guidelines were immediately put into place with the goal to protect farms and stop the spreading of the disease. This however did not prevent further rapid spread of BTV-8 across Northern Europe. Using information on the 2006 Bluetongue outbreak in cattle farms in Belgium, a spatio-temporal transmission model was formulated. The model quantifies the local transmission of the disease between farms within a municipality, the short-distance transmission between farms across neighbouring municipalities and the transmission as a result of cattle movement. Different municipality-level covariates such as farm density, land composition variables, temperature and precipitation, were assessed as possibly influencing each component of the transmission process. Results showed a significant influence of the different covariates in each model component, particularly the significant effect of temperature and precipitation values in the number of infected farms. The model which allowed us to predict the dynamic spreading of BTV for different movement restriction scenarios, also affirmed the significant impact of cattle movement in the 2006 BTV outbreak pattern. Simulation results further showed the importance of considering the size of restriction zones in the formulation of guidelines for animal infectious diseases.},

abstract = {A simple argument based on the distribution of individuals amongst discrete resource sites is used to show how the form of single species population models depends on the type of competition between, and the spatial clustering of, the individuals. For scramble competition between individuals, we confirm earlier demonstrations that the Ricker model is a direct consequence of a uniform random distribution of individuals across resources. By introducing spatial clustering of individuals according to a negative binomial distribution, we are able to derive the Hassell model. Furthermore, the tent map model is seen to be a consequence of scramble competition and an ideal-free distribution of individuals. To model contest competition under different degrees of spatial clustering we derive a new three-parameter model, of which the Beverton-Holt and Skellam models are special cases, where one of the parameters relates directly to the clustering distribution. Other population models, such as the quadratic model and the theta-Ricker models, cannot be derived in our framework. Taken together our derivations of population models allows us to make a more rigorous prescription for model choice when fitting to particular datasets.},

abstract = {1. The migratory wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus (Burchell)) population of Serengeti has been monitored for 40 years (1958-1998). The population increased from 1963 to 1977, stabilized from 1977 to 1993 and declined during drought in 1993-94. These changes provided a significant contrast in densities and the opportunity to determine the life history stages where survival was density dependent and their causes. 2. There was a delay in age of maturity and a decline of both yearling and adult pregnancy rates at higher densities. Changes in yearling pregnancy had minimal effect on number of calves born. Adult pregnancy rate dropped from 95{\%} to 88{\%} 3. The greatest absolute mortality occurred in newborn calves (0-4 months old). The most variable survival was in dry-season calf mortality (5-11 months old). 4. Density dependence was clearly present in adult mortality and this appeared to be the regulating life stage. Density dependence was also found in dry-season calf mortality. The drop in pregnancy rate was only weakly density dependent. 5. The main cause of mortality (75{\%} of cases) was undernutrition. Bone marrow condition showed that more animals died in extremely poor condition as the population increased and predators did not cause these deaths. 6. Predation played only a minor role in limiting the wildebeest population. Predators caught animals in moderate condition during the increase phase and increasingly healthy condition during years of high population density. The main predators were lion [Panthera leo (Linnaeus)] and hyaena (Crocuta crocuta Erxleben). 7. Adult mortality was significantly negatively related to food per capita. This could be viewed either as curvilinear density dependence, or as two phases of mortality. The first phase was during population increase when mortality was inversely density dependent and may have been caused by a constant predation rate. The second was during stability and decline and comprised the additive effects of undernutrition and predation. 8. Rainfall in the dry season was the most important extrinsic determinant of food supply for the wildebeest population but food was related to mortality only when population density was incorporated. 9. At present the wildebeest population appears regulated by natural causes through food supply. Human-caused mortality appears to be a minor factor. However, if the number of wildebeest killed by humans increases as human population increases, then there could be a permanent decline in wildebeest, and a major change in the whole ecosystem, because wildebeest are the keystone species. Continued monitoring is essential for conservation of the Serengeti ecosystem.},

abstract = {Most current wildlife habitat models, such as resource selection functions, typically assume a static environment, extrapolate poorly in space and time, and often lack linkages to population processes. We submit that more mechanistic habitat models that directly consider bottom-up resources affecting growth and reproduction (i.e., food) and top-down limitations affecting survival are needed to effectively predict habitat quality, especially in the presence of rapid environmental change. Here we present a general model for estimating potential habitat quality (relating to growth and reproduction) and realised habitat quality (accounting for survival) using basic knowledge of the species' seasonal diet, predicted locations of food resource patches and regional patterns in mortality risk. We illustrate our model for a threatened population of grizzly bears in west-central Alberta. Bi-monthly potential habitat quality successfully predicted habitat selection by radio-collared grizzly bears, while multi-seasonal realised habitat quality predicted patterns in occupancy-abundance as measured from unique bears at hair-snag sites. Bottom-up resources therefore predicted patterns of habitat selection, while top-down processes (survival) were necessary to scale-up to population measures. We suggest that more direct measures of resources and environments that affect growth, reproduction and survival, as well as match the temporal scale of animal behaviour, be considered when developing wildlife habitat models. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We tested whether cropping or digestion by Thomson's gazelles (Gazella thomsoni) constrains daily energy intake under sward conditions normally encountered during the growing season. Distinguishing between these alternatives is important in un- derstanding grass–grazer interactions and modeling grazer energetics. Grazing trials on artificial swards showed that gazelles had a monotonically saturating functional response, but that relationships between grazing rate and forage density changed with grass height. Grazing rate was positively related to biomass on short swards, yet there was no significant relationship for tall swards. Bite mass and bite rate also differed in their relationship to biomass across sward heights, with the strongest relationships being found on short swards. Bite rate and bite mass were inversely related, as predicted by current theory for dense grass swards. Voluntary energy intake on a daily basis was a positive function of the digestible energy content of forage, but a negative function of sward biomass. Therefore, our results indicate that daily energy intake is constrained by digestive processes on swards with biomass ?25 g/m2 , whereas intake is constrained by cropping processes at lower sward biomass. Our data additionally suggest that variation in bite rate and bite mass with sward height could permit a small ruminant to select high-quality grass, thereby achieving high energy gain on immature swards.},

abstract = {Interactions between apex and mesopredators and their impacts on prey populations have been well documented, while the influence of apex predators such as lions on carrion availability and the subsequent impacts at lower trophic levels are not fully understood. Here we assess dietary overlap between two sympatric carnivores (brown hyaena, Parahyaena brunnea, and black-backed jackal, Canis mesomelas) in neighbouring reserves with and without apex predators (lions, Panthera leo, and wild dog, Lycaon pictus). We investigate whether apex predators facilitate niche partitioning between mesocarnivores by creating additional scavenging opportunities through predatory activity. We found that brown hyaena density was higher in the area with apex predators, while black-backed jackal density was higher in the area without apex predators. Black-backed jackal scats contained broadly similar dietary items at both sites, while large mammal remains occurred significantly more frequently in brown hyaena scats collected in the presence of apex predators. In the absence of apex predators there was a markedly higher degree of overlap between brown hyaena and jackal diets, suggesting increased levels of inter-specific competition. Our results suggest that apex predators potentially reduce levels of inter-specific competition for food between mesocarnivores by providing additional scavenging opportunities for specialist scavengers such as brown hyaena.},

abstract = {The success of efforts to re-establish mammalian carnivores within their former range is dependent on three key factors: methodological considerations, the biological requirements of the target species, and the involvement of local human communities for whom large carnivores pose a threat. We consider the role of these factors in the first 13 years of an effort to re-establish wild lions in northern KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. We employed soft-release methods to mitigate the characteristic problems associated with restoration of large carnivores. A pre-release captivity period facilitated acclimatization of reintroduced lions and promoted long-term bonding of unfamiliar individuals into cohesive groups. All individuals remained in the release area and established enduring, stable home ranges. Reintroduced lions successfully reproduced and raised 78{\%} of their cubs to independence. Human activity was the cause of all post-release mortality. Despite rapid population growth and the re-establishment of the species at Phinda Private Game Reserve, the population is small and isolated with little prospect for re-colonizing additional areas where the species has been extirpated, or for connecting with other isolated lion populations in the region. Accordingly, although we essentially overcame the short-term technical and biological challenges facing lion reintroduction, the long-term value of the Phinda population for addressing the conservation issues facing the species remains equivocal.},

abstract = {1. A model is described which provides a mechanistic explanation of the functional response of intake rate to herbage availability [Leaf Area Index (LAI), height or mass] in large herbivores. 2. When grazing non-selectively (between plant species) rates of encounter (cf. search times) are unlikely to be limiting even at low herbage LAI in cool-temperate pastures. Bite rate and intake rate are limited by handling time. Even at low herbage LAI, the fixed time cost associated with opening and closing the jaw to prehend a bite limits the capacity of animals to compensate for low bite mass by increasing bite rate and so restricts intake rate. 3. The model proposes that differences in the time taken to masticate a unit bite mass are necessary to explain the major differences in intake rate between large-mouthed animals (e.g. cattle) and sheep grazing from the same sward. 4. When grazing selectively (between plant species) search times increase substantially and may come to limit intake rate as total herbage availability (both plant species) declines, or as the fractional cover of the more desirable species declines below about 20{\%}. The selective grazing strategies and optimal diets, those which provide maximum net daily energy balance and/or 'value' to the grazing animal, are identified for animals grazing from plant species that differ in both the relative vertical availability (height, mass) and relative horizontal availability (fractional cover) as well as the total availability of herbage. 5. A decrease in the relative horizontal availability of a species reduces selectivity, but only to the point of indifference. A decrease in the relative vertical availability of a species may reverse species preferences.},

More cattle were killed by lions during the wet season (October to May) than during the dry months (June to September). In the wetter months, corresponding to the growing season and the need to protect crops, cattle were herded further from their home enclosures, closer to PA boundaries and into more wooded habitats. By contrast, cattle remained closer to home, further from PAs and were left to graze in fallow fields close to villages in the dry months. Seasonal use of wooded areas distant to villages and close to PA boundaries during the growing season increases vulnerability of cattle to lion depredation. In the dry months, cattle grazing close to villages benefit from the close proximity of people, resulting in a lower incidence of depredation. Approaches to mitigate livestock depredation should focus on improving herd protection during the wet season when cattle graze far from villages. Strategies such as communal herding, more intensive livestock guarding and, where possible, avoidance of heavily wooded habitats close to PAs should be encouraged.},

abstract = {Citizen science has the potential to expand the scope and scale of research in ecology and conservation, but many professional researchers remain skeptical of data produced by nonexperts. We devised an approach for producing accurate, reliable data from untrained, nonexpert volunteers. On the citizen science website www.snapshotserengeti.org, more than 28,000 volunteers classified 1.51 million images taken in a large-scale camera-trap survey in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. Each image was circulated to, on average, 27 volunteers, and their classifications were aggregated using a simple plurality algorithm. We validated the aggregated answers against a data set of 3829 images verified by experts and calculated 3 certainty metrics-level of agreement among classifications (evenness), fraction of classifications supporting the aggregated answer (fraction support), and fraction of classifiers who reported "nothing here" for an image that was ultimately classified as containing an animal (fraction blank)-to measure confidence that an aggregated answer was correct. Overall, aggregated volunteer answers agreed with the expert-verified data on 98{\%} of images, but accuracy differed by species commonness such that rare species had higher rates of false positives and false negatives. Easily calculated analysis of variance and post-hoc Tukey tests indicated that the certainty metrics were significant indicators of whether each image was correctly classified or classifiable. Thus, the certainty metrics can be used to identify images for expert review. Bootstrapping analyses further indicated that 90{\%} of images were correctly classified with just 5 volunteers per image. Species classifications based on the plurality vote of multiple citizen scientists can provide a reliable foundation for large-scale monitoring of African wildlife.},

abstract = {1. Many Indian mammals face range contraction and extinction, but assessments of their population status are hindered by the lack of reliable distribution data and range maps.2. We estimated the current geographical ranges of 20 species of large mammals by applying occupancy models to data from country-wide expert. We modelled species in relation to ecological and social covariates (protected areas, landscape characteristics and human influences) based on a priori hypotheses about plausible determinants of mammalian distribution patterns.3. We demonstrated that failure to incorporate detection probability in distribution survey methods underestimated habitat occupancy for all species.4. Protected areas were important for the distribution of 16 species. However, for many species much of their current range remains unprotected. The availability of evergreen forests was important for the occurrence of 14 species, temperate forests for six species, deciduous forests for 15 species and higher altitude habitats for two species. Low human population density was critical for the occurrence of five species, while culturally based tolerance was important for the occurrence of nine other species.5. Rhino Rhinoceros unicornis, gaur Bos gaurus and elephant Elephas maximus showed the most restricted ranges among herbivores, and sun bear Helarctos malayanus, brown bear Ursus arctos and tiger Panthera tigris were most restricted among carnivores. While cultural tolerance has helped the survival of some mammals, legal protection has been critically associated with occurrence of most species.6. Synthesis and applications. Extent of range is an important determinant of species conservation status. Understanding the relationship of species occurrence with ecological and socio-cultural covariates is important for identification and management of key conservation areas. The combination of occupancy models with field data from country-wide experts enables reliable estimation of species range and habitat associations for conservation at regional scales.},

abstract = {Conflict between people and felids is one of the most urgent wild cat conservation issues worldwide, yet efforts to synthesize knowledge about these conflicts have been few. For management strategies to be effective a thorough understanding of the dynamics of human-felid conflicts is necessary. Here we present the results of a cross- species, systematic review of human-felid conflicts worldwide. Using a combination of literature review and geographical information system analyses, we provide a quantitative as well as qualitative assessment of patterns and determinants that are known to influence the severity of human-felid conflicts, and a geographical overview of the occurrence of conflict worldwide.We found evidence of conflict affecting over 75{\%} of the world's felid species. The severity of conflict increases with felid body mass and is of greatest conservation significance to nine species: caracal, cheetah, Eurasian lynx, jaguar, leopard, lion, puma, snow leopard and tiger. We also reveal specific gaps in knowledge about human-felid conflicts, and required actions within this aspect of felid conservation. With only 31{\%} of implemented management strategies having been evaluated scientifically, there is a need for greater and more rigorous evaluation and a wider dis- semination of results. Also urgently required are standardized reporting techniques toreduce thecurrentdisparity inconflict reporting methods and facilitate resolution of patterns and trends in the scale of human-felid conflict worldwide. This review provides a basis both for further synthesis and for the coordination of human-felid conflict management among researchers, practitioners and organizations.},

Increasingly, surveillance systems are capturing spatial and temporal data on disease and health outcomes in a variety of public health contexts. A vast and growing suite of methods exists for detection of outbreaks and trends in surveillance data and the selection of appropriate methods in a given surveillance context is not always clear. While most reviews of methods focus on algorithm performance, in practice, a variety of factors determine what methods are appropriate for surveillance. In this review, we focus on the role of contextual factors such as scale, scope, surveillance objective, disease characteristics, and technical issues in relation to commonly used approaches to surveillance. Methods are classified as testing-based or model-based approaches. Reviewing methods in the context of factors other than algorithm performance highlights important aspects of implementing and selecting appropriate disease surveillance methods. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In 1992, tourist hunting in the Selous Game Reserve generated 1.28 million dollars for the Tanzanian government, of which 0.96 million dollars were returned to wildlife conservation. Lions (Panthera lee) are one of three critical species for tourist hunting, consistently generating 12{\%}-13{\%} of hunting revenue from 1988 to 1992, Because of their ecological and economic importance (and intrinsic value), it is important that lion quotas be set so that offtake is sustainable. The population density of lions in Selous ranges from 0.08 to 0.13 adults km(-2), comparable to unhunted ecosystems. The adult sex ratio (36-41{\%} male) and the ratio of cubs to adults (29{\%} cubs) are similar to those of unhunted populations, The ratio of lions to hyaenas is lower in heavily hunted areas (0.17 lions/hyena) than in unhunted areas (0.43 lions/hyena). Hunting: levels between 1989 and 1994 took 2.7-4.3{\%} of adult males annually, which is sustainable. The current quota is 10- 16{\%} of the adult male population, which exceeds natural mortality rates for male lions. To remain stable if the quota was filled, the population would have to compensate via increased fecundity, increased juvenile survival, or an altered sex-ratio. Compensation occurs in Selous by producing (Or raising) more male than female cubs (66-81{\%} of juveniles are male). Only 28{\%} of the Selous quota was filled in 1992. The percentage of quota filled (both in Selous and nationwide) has dropped since 1988 as quotas have increased, The current intensity of lion hunting in Selous is sustainable, but the quota cannot be filled sustainably.},

abstract = {Aspects of reproduction in two species of jackals (Canis adustus and Canis mesomelas) from Zimbabwe were studied using reproductive organs of jackal carcasses submitted for rabies testing or collected during culls. In C. adustus, parturition took place from early September to early October and in C. mesomelas during September and October. The female reproductive cycle was synchronized in both species. Eighty percent of females bred in any particular year and 20{\%} of those that bred lost their litters soon after birth. The average litter size at birth of C. adustus was 5.8 (n = 16, range 3-8) and of C. mesomelas 4.6 (n = 30, range 1-8). The productivity of the two species was estimated at 1.8 and 1.5 pups per adult per year for C. adustus and C. mesomelas, respectively. These data suggest that jackal populations are capable of very rapid recovery following population crashes and that populations will fluctuate seasonally, with peak densities of independent, mobile jackals (capable of participating in rabies cycles) occurring around December and January.},

A conditional probability model is used to model the interdependence between the risk of infection and the level of health awareness acquired. The model is applied to study the spread of HIV/Aids, malaria, and tuberculosis in the South African province Limpopo. The simulation results show that the effect of various awareness interventions can be very different and that a concerted effort to spread health awareness through various channels is more likely to control the spread of these preventable infections in a reasonable time.},

abstract = {We conducted a questionnaire survey among 77 cattle posts and farms to investigate human-carnivore conflicts in northern Botswana, with a particular focus on Endangered African wild dog Lycaon pictus, persecuted throughout their shrinking range in sub-Saharan Africa for allegedly predating livestock. Predator attacks on livestock (n5938 conflict reports) represent an economic concern for livestock owners, particularly alleged predation by black-backed jackal Canis mesomelas, which were blamed for 77{\%} of all reported livestock losses. The presence of two known resident packs of wild dogs did not result in corresponding conflict reports with livestock owners, as wild dogs accounted for only 2{\%} of reported predator attacks and largely subsisted on wild prey. Nevertheless, most of these wild dogs were killed in the months fol- lowing this survey. Reported conflicts involving the two largest predator species (lion Panthera leo and spotted hyaena Crocuta crocuta) declined with increasing distance from protected areas. Leaving livestock unattended during the day seems to facilitate predation but kraaling livestock at night reduces predation. Compensation payments for livestock losses did not demonstrably change livestock owners' willingness to coexist with predators. Our results corroborate studies from elsewhere that simple improve- ments in livestock husbandry practices would help mitigate human-carnivore conflicts.},

abstract = {The focus on human–wildlife conflict has often been a constraint to wildlife conservation, as practitioners have centered their attention on reducing negative interactions, rather than on increasing positive relations between humans and wildlife. To work toward solutions that maximize conservation success, it is necessary to include positive interactions, coexistence, and attitudes of tolerance toward wildlife. In this article, clarification and definition of the terms conflict, coexistence, and tolerance are offered and human–wildlife interactions are explored along a continuum that ranges from negative to positive attitudes. Such an approach allows highlighting the multiple dimensions influencing human–wildlife relationships, thus drawing attention to other possible pathways to address wildlife issues.},

abstract = {Large carnivores have declined worldwide, largely through conflict with people. Here, we quantify the impact of lethal control, associated with livestock depredation, on a population of African lions (Panthera leo) living outside protected areas. Farmers shot lions only in response to livestock attacks. Nevertheless, adult mortality was high and a simple model predicted that the population was marginally stable or slowly declining. Mortality was four times higher among lions radio-collared in association with attacks on livestock, than among lions with no known history of stock killing, suggesting that some animals were habitual stock killers. Known stock killers also experienced lower reproductive success; hence there was strong artificial selection against stock-killing behaviour. In addition, mortality was higher among lions whose home ranges overlapped a property where non-traditional livestock husbandry was associated with chronic depredation by lions. This 180 km2 ranch acted as a sink that directly affected lions over more than 2000 km2 and may have undermined the viability of the study population. Our results suggest that sustainable coexistence of lions and people demands livestock husbandry that effectively deters predators from acquiring stock-killing behaviour, but that lethal control may play an important role in avoiding the spread of such behaviours through the population. 2005 The Zoological Society of London.},

abstract = {Because most large, terrestrial mammalian predators have already been lost from more than 95-99{\%} of the contiguous United States and Mexico, many ecological communities are either missing dominant selective forces or have new ones dependent upon humans. Such large-scale manipulations of a key element of most ecosystems offer unique opportunities to investigate how the loss of large carnivores affects communities, including the extent, if any, of interactions at different trophic levels. Here, we demonstrate a cascade of ecological events that were triggered by the local extinction of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and wolves (Canis lupus) from the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. These include (1) the demographic eruption of a large, semi-obligate, riparian-dependent herbivore, the moose (Alces alces), during the past 150 yr; (2) the subsequent alteration of riparian vegetation structure and density by ungulate herbivory; and (3) the coincident reduction of avian neotropical migrants in the impacted willow communities. We contrasted three sites matched hydrologically and ecologically in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, USA, where grizzly bears and wolves had been eliminated 60-75 yr ago and moose densities were about five times higher, with those on national forest lands outside the park, where predation by the two large carnivores has been replaced by human hunting and moose densities were lower. Avian species richness and nesting density varied inversely with moose abundance, and two riparian specialists, Gray Catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis) and MacGillivray's Warblers (Oporornis tolmiei), were absent from Park riparian systems where moose densities were high. Our findings not only offer empirical support for the top-down effect of large carnivores in terrestrial communities, but also provide a scientific rationale for restoration options to conserve biological diversity. To predict future impacts, whether overt or subtle, of past management, and to restore biodiversity, more must be known about ecological interactions, including the role of large carnivores. Restoration options with respect to the system that we studied in the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem are simple: (1) do nothing and accept the erosion of biological diversity, (2) replace natural carnivores with human predation, or (3) allow continued dispersal of grizzly bears and wolves into previously occupied, but now vacant, habitat. Although additional science is required to further our understanding of this and other terrestrial systems, a larger conservation challenge remains: to develop public support for ecologically rational conservation options.},

abstract = {More and more, development organizations are under pressure to demonstrate that their programs result in significant and lasting changes in the well-being of their intended beneficiaries. However, such "impacts" are often the product of a confluence of events for which no single agency or group of agencies can realistically claim full credit. As a result, assessing development impacts is problematic, yet many organizations continue to struggle to measure results far beyond the reach of their programs. Outcome Mapping recognizes that development is essentially about people relating to each other and their environment. The originality of this approach lies in its shift away from assessing the products of a program to focus on changes in behaviour, relationships, actions, and activities in the people, groups, and organizations it works with directly. In doing so, Outcome Mapping debunks many of the myths about measuring impact. It will help a program be specific about the actors it targets, the changes it expects to see, and the strategies it employs and, as a result, be more effective in terms of the results it achieves. This publication explains the various steps in the outcome mapping approach and provides detailed information on workshop design and facilitation. It includes numerous worksheets and examples.},

abstract = {The capture of prey by the African lion in Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania, is examined. For analytic purposes the process is envisaged as a consecutive set of events: searching, stalking, attacking, and subduing prey. Initiation of prey capture activity by the lion arises from the interaction of degree of stimulation presented by the prey, timing of the activity cycle of the lion (diurnal or nocturnal), and its level of hunger. These factors yield thresholds for initiation which result in kills being directly related to prey density at high and low densities and inversely density dependent at intermediate prey densities. Success in stalking appears to depend primarily upon the failure of the prey to see the approaching lion until it is within its effective distance. Using data from actual stalks and contrived experiments, the probability is calculated of the lion being detected for a range of conditions. The attack involves a matching of the sprinting abilities of the predator and prey. To analyze this aspect in detail, the velocity curves of running are defined for the lion and four prey species.

abstract = {By linking iterative learning and knowledge generation with power-sharing, adaptive co-management (ACM) provides a potential solution to resolving complex social-ecological problems. In this paper we evaluate ACM as a mechanism for resolving conservation conflict using a case study in Scotland, where seal and salmon fishery stakeholders have opposing and entrenched objectives. ACM emerged in 2002, successfully resolving this long-standing conflict. Applying evaluation approaches from the literature, in 2011 we interviewed stakeholders to characterise the evolution of ACM, and factors associated with its success over 10 years. In common with other ACM cases, triggers for the process were shifts in slow variables controlling the system (seal and salmon abundance, public perceptions of seal shooting), and exogenous shocks (changes in legal mandates, a seal disease outbreak). Also typical of ACM, three phases of evolution were evident: emerging local leadership preparing the system for change, a policy window of opportunity, and stakeholder partnerships building the resilience of the system. Parameters maintaining ACM were legal mechanisms and structures, legal power held by government, and the willingness of all stakeholders to reach a compromise and experiment with an alternative governance approach. Results highlighted the critical role of government power and support in resolving conservation conflict, which may constrain the extent of local stakeholder-driven ACM. The evaluation also demonstrated how, following perceived success, the trajectory of ACM has shifted to a 'stakeholder apathy' phase, with declining leadership, knowledge exchange, stakeholder engagement, and system resilience. We discuss remedial actions required to revive the process, and the importance of long term government resourcing and alternative financing schemes for successful conflict resolution. Based on the results we present a generic indicator framework and participatory method for the longitudinal evaluation of ACM applied to conservation conflict resolution.},

However, past analyses have not taken into account the differing selection shown by carnivores for specific size ranges of prey, nor the extent to which the greater carcass mass of larger prey outweighs the greater numerical representation of smaller prey species in the predator diet. Furthermore, the top-down impact that predation has on prey abundance cannot be assessed simply in terms of the number of predator species involved. 2. Records of found carcasses and cause of death assembled over 46 years in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, corrected for under-recording of smaller species, enabled a definitive assessment of size relationships between large mammalian carnivores and their ungulate prey. Five carnivore species were considered, including lion (Panthera leo), leopard (Panthera pardus), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) and spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), and 22 herbivore prey species larger than 10 kg in adult body mass. 3. These carnivores selectively favoured prey species approximately half to twice their mass, within a total prey size range from an order of magnitude below to an order of magnitude above the body mass of the predator. The three smallest carnivores, i.e. leopard, cheetah and wild dog, showed high similarity in prey species favoured. Despite overlap in prey size range, each carnivore showed a distinct dietary preference. 4. Almost all mortality was through the agency of a predator for ungulate species up to the size of a giraffe (800-1200 kg). Ungulates larger than twice the mass of the predator contributed substantially to the dietary intake of lions, despite the low proportional mortality inflicted by predation on these species. Only for megaherbivores substantially exceeding 1000 kg in adult body mass did predation become a negligible cause of mortality. 5. Hence, the relative size of predators and prey had a pervasive structuring influence on biomass fluxes within this large-mammal food web. Nevertheless, the large carnivore assemblage was dominated overwhelmingly by the largest predator, which contributed the major share of animals killed across a wide size range.},

abstract = {Modelers often need to quantify the rates at which zooplankton consume a variety of species, size classes and trophic types. Implicit in the equations used to describe the multiple resource functional response (i.e. how nutritional intake varies with resource densities) are assumptions that are not often stated, let alone tested. This is problematic because models are sensitive to the details of these formulations. Here, we enable modelers to make more informed decisions by providing them with a new framework for considering zooplankton feeding on multiple resources. We define a new classification of multiple resource responses that is based on preference, selection and switching, and we develop a set of mathematical diagnostics that elucidate model assumptions. We use these tools to evaluate the assumptions and biological dynamics inherent in published multiple resource responses. These models are shown to simulate different resource preferences, implied single resource responses, changes in intake with changing resource densities, nutritional benefits of generalism, and nutritional costs of selection. Certain formulations are further shown to exhibit anomalous dynamics such as negative switching and sub-optimal feeding. Such varied responses can have vastly different ecological consequences for both zooplankton and their resources; inappropriate choices may incorrectly quantify biologically-mediated fluxes and predict spurious dynamics. We discuss how our classes and diagnostics can help constrain parameters, interpret behaviors, and identify limitations to a formulation's applicability for both regional (e.g. High-Nitrate-Low- Chlorophyll regions comprising large areas of the Pacific) and large-scale applications (e.g. global biogeochemical or climate change models). Strategies for assessing uncertainty and for using the mathematics to guide future experimental investigations are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In studies of animal space use, researchers often use kernel-based techniques for estimating the size of an animal's home range and its utilization distribution from radiotracking data. However, the kernel estimator is highly sensitive to the bandwidth value used. Previous ecological studies recommended least-squares cross-validation (LSCV) as the default bandwidth selection method, but some statisticians consider this technique inferior to newer methods. We used simulations to compare the performance of the scaling LSCV and reference approaches to plug-in and solve-the-equation (STE) bandwidth methods. We generated samples of 20, 50, and 150 points frommixtures of 2, 4, and 16 bivariate normal distributions. We selected the ranges of potential variances for these distributions to create 4 distribution types with varied levels of clumping to simulate the diversity of location patterns expected from radiotracking data. For most distribution types, plug-in and STE methods performed as well or better than LSCV in {\%} absolute error of home-range size estimates and overlap of estimated and true utilization distributions. Although the relative differences usually were small, the plug-in and STE approaches provide good alternatives to LSCV. However, LSCV performed better with distribution types composed entirely of tight clumps of points. The reference bandwidth performed poorly for most distributions. Surprisingly, it often had the lowest absolute error at outer contours for distributions consisting of a single very tight cluster surrounded by more dispersed points. Although our results demonstrate the utility of plug-in and STE approaches, no method was best across all distributions. Rather, choice of a bandwidth selection method may vary depending on the study goals, sample size, and patterns of space use by the study species. In general, we recommend plug-in and STE approaches for estimating relatively smooth outer contours. The LSCV approach is better at identifying tight clumps, including areas of peak use, although risk of LSCV failure also increases when a distribution has a very tight cluster of points. When planning to use kernel methods, researchers should consider these factors to make preliminary decisions about the bandwidth method expected to be most appropriate in their study.},

Since 1959, Holling's prey-dependent Type II functional response, a model that is a function of prey abundance only, has served as the basis for a large literature on predator–prey theory. We present statistical evidence from 19 predator–prey systems that three predator-dependent functional responses (Beddington-DeAngelis, Crowley-Martin, and Hassell-Varley), i.e., models that are functions of both prey and predator abundance because of predator interference, can provide better descriptions of predator feeding over a range of predator–prey abundances. No single functional response best describes all of the data sets. Given these functional forms, we suggest use of the Beddington-DeAngelis or Hassell-Varley model when predator feeding rate becomes independent of predator density at high prey density and use of the Crowley-Martin model when predator feeding rate is decreased by higher predator density even when prey density is high.},

abstract = {The use of wildlife corridors to maintain landscape connectivity has become increasingly relevant to the conservation of wide-ranging species, including the jaguar  Panthera onca . Jaguars are particularly threatened in Mexico, where corridor linkages are tenuous as a result of habitat fragmentation. Our study assessed a section of potential corridor south of the Sierra Madre Oriental in eastern Mexico. We conducted 245 interviews with local inhabitants in 140 36-km2 sampling units over a 5-month period and compiled detection histories for jaguars and five prey species: collared peccary  Pecari tajacu , red brocket deer  Mazama americana , white-tailed deer  Odocoileus virginianus , spotted paca  Agouti paca , and nine-banded armadillo  Dasypus novemcinctus . These detection histories were then analysed using site occupancy modelling. Each sampling unit was assigned a probability of habitat use based on (1) the two smaller prey species (paca and armadillo) and (2) at least two of the larger prey species (collared peccary and two deer species) using habitat in that unit. This probability estimate was considered a proxy for the prey base of each sampling unit and therefore the unit's suitability as a jaguar corridor. Although the prey base in some areas appears adequate to support a jaguar population, large-scale development projects and the paucity of jaguar sign are major obstacles to this region's potential as a jaguar corridor. Our results suggest that the eastern coast of Mexico may not be a priority area for range-wide jaguar conservation.},

abstract = {Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behav- ioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy- value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescahng of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past be- havior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited avail- able evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reli- ability.},

Simple resource-controlled and consumer-controlled food chain models can explain different subsets of these patterns. However, models of heterogeneous food webs that incorporate differences among species within trophic levels, and compositional turnover within such trophic levels, are consistent with all of the reviewed patterns.

abstract = {The Endangered snow leopard Panthera uncia occurs in the Central Asian Mountains, which cover c. 2 million km 2 . Little is known about its status in the Kyrgyz Alay Mountains, a relatively narrow stretch of habitat connecting the southern and northern global ranges of the species. In 2010 we gathered information on current and past (1990, the last year of the Soviet Union) distributions of snow leopards and five sympatric large mammals across 14,000 km 2 of the Kyrgyz Alay. We interviewed 95 key informants from local communities. Across 49 400-km 2 grid cells we obtained 1,606 and 962 records of species occurrence (site use) in 1990 and 2010, respectively. The data were analysed using the multi-season site occupancy framework to incorporate uncertainty in detection across interviewees and time periods. High probability of use by snow leopards in the past was recorded in {\textgreater} 70{\%} of the Kyrgyz Alay. Between the two sampling periods 39{\%} of sites showed a high probability of local extinction of snow leopard. We also recorded high probability of local extinction of brown bear Ursus arctos (84{\%} of sites) and Marco Polo sheep Ovis ammon polii (47{\%} of sites), mainly in regions used intensively by people. Data indicated a high probability of local colonization by lynx Lynx lynx in 41{\%} of the sites. Although wildlife has declined in areas of central and eastern Alay, regions in the north-west, and the northern and southern fringes appear to retain high conservation value.},

abstract = {Many populations of threatened mammals persist outside formally protected areas, and their survival depends on the willingness of communities to coexist with them. An understanding of the attitudes, and specifically the tolerance, of individuals and communities and the factors that determine these is therefore fundamental to designing strategies to alleviate human-wildlife conflict. We conducted a meta-analysis to identify factors that affected attitudes toward 4 groups of terrestrial mammals. Elephants (65{\%}) elicited the most positive attitudes, followed by primates (55{\%}), ungulates (53{\%}), and carnivores (44{\%}). Urban residents presented the most positive attitudes (80{\%}), followed by commercial farmers (51{\%}) and communal farmers (26{\%}). A tolerance to damage index showed that human tolerance of ungulates and primates was proportional to the probability of experiencing damage while elephants elicited tolerance levels higher than anticipated and carnivores elicited tolerance levels lower than anticipated. Contrary to conventional wisdom, experiencing damage was not always the dominant factor determining attitudes. Communal farmers had a lower probability of being positive toward carnivores irrespective of probability of experiencing damage, while commercial farmers and urban residents were more likely to be positive toward carnivores irrespective of damage. Urban residents were more likely to be positive toward ungulates, elephants, and primates when probability of damage was low, but not when it was high. Commercial and communal farmers had a higher probability of being positive toward ungulates, primates, and elephants irrespective of probability of experiencing damage. Taxonomic bias may therefore be important. Identifying the distinct factors explaining these attitudes and the specific contexts in which they operate, inclusive of the species causing damage, will be essential for prioritizing conservation investments.},
annote = {HWC is more than simply competition for space, food and life - it pits different values for nature against one another, demanding attention from economic, legal, social and environmental policy makers.

Attitudes - definted as a disposition or tendency to respond with some degree of favourableness, or not, to a psychological object, the psychological object being any discernible aspect of an individuals world including an object, a person, an issue or a behavior.

Attitude construct important for humans to cope with world, and center of attempts to predict and explain human behaviour.

Tolerance index realtes attitude to amount of damage. People are tolerant of elephant damage, liking them more than they should with the amount of damage, ungulates and primates are liked relative to the amount of damage and carnivores are disliked more than they should be for the amount of damage

Everyone has negative TDI (intolerent) other stakeholders most intolerant (-.32) then communal farmers (-.2) urban residents (-.19) and commercial farmers (-.05)

Attitudes affected by stakeholder group, question type, species group, development status of country and if directly involved with conflict.

Amount of damage also cntributes significantly to the attitudes.

Species with high probabil- ities of eliciting positive attitudes were tiger (odds ratio= 2.4), wild dog (Lycaon pictus) (odds ratio = 1.86), lion (Panthera leo leo) (odds ratio = 1.64), leopard (Panthera pardus) (odds ratio = 1.63), cheetah (Aci- nonyx jubatus) (odds ratio = 1.2), and jackal (Canis mesomelas) (odds ratio = 1.2). The species that were significantly more likely to elicit a nonpositive attitude were wolverine (Gulo gulo) (odds ratio = 0.8), wolf (Canis lupus) (odds ratio = 0.66), bear (Ursus spp.) (odds ratio = 0.65), hyena (Crocuta crocuta, Hyaena sp.) (odds ratio=0.57), and coyote (Canis latrans) (odds ratio = 0.3)

Why do carnivores elicit less tolerance? Added value of livestock, fear, cultural values.

These findings support the results of similar research where damage was not significant in explain- ing attitudes toward a species in 61{\%} of publications (R.K. unpublished data)

Damage not a main driver of attitudes, if not then mitigation damage offers poor returns of funds as not addressing the problem. Identifying costs and benefits of species important as spending money on mitigation measures may actually make attitudes worse as people seen to be wasting money on animals. Need to look at tangible and intangible costs of living with wildlife.

Communal farmers most likely to have non positive attitudes, and least positive towards carnivores, though a small subset of communal farmers who were more positive when a larger probability of undergoing damage, so some able to adapt to living near dangerous wildlife. This often has cultural underpinning, 575 of communal farmers in high probability of damage category from Asia, eastern religions may promote tolerance for instance in Nepal snow leapoard damage seen as a punishment from god, so shifts blame from species.

communal farmers least positive toward carnivores, livestock bigger contribution to well being - safety net, earnings, more diverse range of benefits. Rural communities more exposed to carnivores in day to day living, carnovores can be dangerous so people suffer disproportionatly from fear and attacks. Commercial farmers better able to protect from predators and less reliant on lifestock, or benefit from carnivores in other ways ie tourism or trophy hunting.},

abstract = {Conserving threatened carnivore species increas-ingly depends on the capacity of local people to cohabit with those species. To examine such capacity we developed a novel psychological framework for conservation in regions of the world where there are human–carnivore conflicts, and used the Endangered tiger Panthera tigris to explore the utility of this framework. Specifically, we tested three hypotheses in Chitwan National Park, Nepal, where increasing human–tiger conflicts potentially jeopardize long-term coexistence. We administered a survey to 499 individuals living , 2 km from the Park and in nearby multiple-use forest, to record preferred future tiger population size and factors that may influence preferences, including past interactions with tigers (e.g. livestock predation) and beliefs and perceptions about tigers. Over 17{\%} of respondents reported that a tiger had attacked their livestock or threatened them directly. Results from a structural equation model indicated that respondents who preferred fewer tigers in the future were less likely to associate tigers with beneficial attributes, more likely to associate tigers with undesirable attributes, and more likely to believe that government officials poorly manage tiger-related risks and that people are vulnerable to risks from tigers. Our framework can help address current and future conservation challenges because it (1) integrates an expansive and generalized set of psychological concepts, (2) enables the identification of conservation interventions that foster coexistence between people and carnivores, and (3) is suitable for broad application.},

abstract = {Migratory ungulates may be particularly vulnerable to the challenges imposed by growing human populations and climate change. These species depend on vast areas to sustain their migratory behavior, and in many cases come into frequent contact with human populations outside protected areas. They may also act as spatial coupling agents allowing feedbacks between ecological systems and local economies, particularly in the agropastoral subsistence economies found in the African savanna biome. We used HUMENTS, a spatially realistic socioecological model of the Greater Serengeti Ecosystem in East Africa, to explore the potential impacts of changing climate and poaching on the migratory wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) population, the fire regime, and habitat structure in the ecosystem, as well as changes in the size and economic activities of the human population outside the protected area. Unlike earlier models, the HUMENTS model predicted only moderate declines in the wildebeest population associated with an increasing human population over the next century, with a gradual expansion of agriculture, more poaching, and increases in fire frequency and reduced tree density. Changes in rainfall were predicted to have strong asymmetric effects on the size and economic activity of the human population and on livestock, and more moderate effects on wildlife and other ecological indicators. Conversely, antipoaching had a stronger effect on the ecological portion of the system because of its effect on wildebeest (and therefore on fire and habitat structure), and a weaker effect on the socioeconomic component, except in areas directly adjacent to the protected-area boundary, which were affected by crop-raiding and the availability of wildlife as a source of income. The results highlight the strong direct and indirect effects of rainfall on the various components of socioecological systems in semiarid environments, and the key role of mobile wildlife populations as agents of spatial coupling between the human-dominated and natural portions of ecosystems. They also underscore the fundamental importance of considering the spatial configuration of hunting refuges across the landscape in relation to human populations.},

abstract = {Ecological understanding is often imprecise and heterogeneous; relationships between different quantities and objects may only be expressed in roughly quantitative or even non-quantitative terms. We argue that there is a need for general time-driven simulation modelling systems capable of utilising these types of understanding, using vegetation dynamics as an example. Although work has gone into developing qualitative models in the past, it has not focussed on the needs of time-driven simulation and there is currently no off-the-shelf solution available. This paper presents a categorisation of the types of knowledge that comprise formal models, then uses the categorisation as the basis for exploring and developing a framework for time-driven simulation modelling with imprecise, heterogeneous knowledge. One of the key concepts presented is the explicit separation of all non-quantitative state variable values from their direction and rate of change. From this concept a general computational method is developed for updating non-quantitative state variables in time-driven simulation. First-order logic is advocated as a suitable representational vehicle and a modelling system that implements the proposed framework is briefly presented. We believe that the framework provides a useful step towards increasing the practical utility of available knowledge. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Occupancy as a surrogate for abundance estimation.— In many monitoring programmes it may be prohibitively expensive to estimate the actual abundance of a bird species in a defined area, particularly at large spatial scales, or where birds occur at very low densities. Often it may be appropriate to consider the proportion of area occupied by the species as an alternative state variable. However, as with abundance estimation, issues of detectability must be taken into account in order to make accurate inferences: the non–detection of the species does not imply the species is genuinely absent. Here we review some recent modelling developments that permit unbiased estimation of the proportion of area occupied, colonization and local extinction probabilities. These methods allow for unequal sampling effort and enable covariate information on sampling locations to be incorporated. We also describe how these models could be extended to incorporate information from marked individuals, which would enable finer questions of population dynamics (such as turnover rate of nest sites by specific breeding pairs) to be addressed. We believe these models may be applicable to a wide range of bird species and may be useful for investigating various questions of ecological interest.

abstract = {Crop and livestock losses to wildlife are a concern for people neighboring many protected areas (PAs) and can generate opposition to conservation. Examining patterns of conflict and associated tolerance is important to devise policies to reduce conflict impacts on people and wildlife. We surveyed 398 households from 178 villages within 10 km of Ranthambore, Kanha, and Nagarahole parks in India. We compared different attitudes toward wildlife, and presented hypothetical response scenarios, including killing the problem animal(s). Eighty percent of households reported crop losses to wildlife and 13 {\%} livestock losses. Higher crop loss was associated with more cropping months per year, greater crop variety, and more harvest seasons per year but did not vary with proximity to the PA, suggesting that PAs are not necessarily "sources" for crop raiders. By contrast, complaints of "depredating carnivores" were associated with people-grazing animals and collecting resources from PAs. Many households (83 {\%}) engaged in mitigation efforts. We found that only fencing and guard animals reduce crop losses, and no efforts to lower livestock losses. Contrary to our expectations, carnivores were not viewed with more hostility than crop-raiding wildlife. Households reported greater inclination to kill herbivores destroying crops or carnivores harming people, but not carnivores preying on livestock.Our model estimated probability of [corrected] crop loss was 82 {\%} across surveyed households (highest in Kanha),while the livestock loss experienced was 27 {\%} (highest in Ranthambore). Our comparative study provides insights into factors associated with conflict loss and tolerance, and aids in improving ongoing conservation and compensation efforts.},

abstract = {During the last decades, there has been a growing interest in the use of models for natural resource management. While early models were theoretical representations of simple systems designed to predict, in time or space, the behaviour of a system, current modelling applications expand beyond prediction. Models, and particularly the whole model building process, have become useful tools to support dialogue, learning and negotiation processes in stakeholders groups. For example, models are currently being used to improve collaboration between expert and stakeholder groups, to facilitate the negotiation between conflicting parties, or as a tool for group reflection, just to mention few of a wide-ranging list of applications. Such a broadened scope in the use of models not only has implications for how models are applied, but also for how the modelling activity is addressed and the type of conclusions that can be drawn from a modelling exercise. It is well known that, the information requirements, the degree of involvement of stakeholders and the type of model evaluation performed, mostly depend on the reason for which a model is developed, despite the modeller's preferences for a particular modelling approach. This paper examines how participatory modelling building affects the modelling practice, specifically focusing on the implications to cope with model uncertainty. A set of strategies to guide the development of participatory models is presented.},

abstract = {Camera trapping is a widespread tool used to study mammals and to derive abundance and density estimates of wild populations. For the majority of Felidae species, individuals are identifiable from camera trap images because of their unique coat patterns; therefore, camera trapping is used extensively for felids to build individual capture histories. For those species not individually identifiable, one can be tempted to use trap success rate as a relative abundance index (RAI) to inform conservation and management decisions, although robust scientific approach can be used for this scenario. Indeed, recent studies have shown that RAIs can be biased by species-specific behaviour, camera trap deployment and by the body size of the species. Here, we investigate how camera trap rates (henceforth RAIs) vary between species within the Felidae and whether these RAIs are related to body mass or camera-trapping approach (whether the species is targeted or not) accounting for likely confounding factors such as trapping effort, inter-trap distance and number of deployed cameras. We explored all the literature available from primary scientific databases dealing with camera trap studies in Felidae. The literature search resulted in 179 studies from which 513 records for 30 felid species from 53 countries were obtained. Across species, the number of detections (accounting for trapping effort) was positively related to species log-body mass and to the targeting of species in the survey. Hence, comparing RAIs across species of different body size and within species with different camera-trapping approaches might be misleading. Accounting for variability in species body mass is of primary importance when designing multi-species camera trap survey, and in the subsequent analysis of data, in addition to conducting trials to test for species-specific camera-trapping responses.},

@article{Kurosaki1995,
abstract = {Production risk is inherent in agriculture due to the spatial nature of farming and its dependence on weather. With a complete set of markets, including insurance markets against risk, a competitive equilibrium is Pareto-optimal (Arrow 2, Debreu 12) and production decisions by farm households are separable from their consumption preferences (Singh et al. 43). Under this condition, production decisions by agricultural households can be analyzed in a model of expected profit maximization without considering higher moments of random variables. If insurance markets are missing or imperfect, however, this separability may no longer hold and risk considerations may affect farm management. The fact that formal insurance arrangements are seldom available in developing countries indicates that insurance markets are incomplete. Following the seminal work of Townsend 44, several authors have shown that rural households in South Asia including Pakistan are insured much better than previously expected but that a hypothesis of optimal risk sharing which is necessary for complete insurance markets is rejected in many cases (Morduch 26 27, Rashid 36). The literature on the economic behavior under uncertainty and incomplete insurance markets has been expanding. The first category covers ex ante adjustments to control the distribution of risk variables, such as enterprise selection and diversifi- cation on the farm and off the farm (Walker and Ryan 46, Fafchamps 14); marketing options including interlinked transactions (Bardhan 4, Goetz 16); and risk-controlling inputs (Just and Pope 19, Rosegrant and Roumasset 37). The second category examines ex post adjustments contingent on a realized state, such as use of credit markets (Eswaran and Kotwal 13, Rosenzweig 38, Udry 45, Morduch 26); accumulation and decumulation of assets such as savings (Deaton 10, Paxson 32), bullocks (Rosenzweig and Wolpin 40), and land (Cain 7, Zimmerman 48); reliance on extended family (Kotlikoff and Spivak 20, Cain 7), marriage relationship (Rosenzweig and Stark 39), or remittances (Rosenzweig 38, Lucas and Stark 25); and establishment of rural reciprocity arrangements (Fafchamps 15, Coate and Ravallion 9). Among these arrangements to overcome the incompleteness in insurance markets, this paper focuses on enterprise selection and on-farm diversification and ac- cumulation/decumulation of farm assets. This is because the most important and theoretically interesting character of agricultural households lies in their simultaneous decisions on production and consumption (Singh et al. 43). Unlike rural consumer/laborer households without production assets, agricultural households can adjust production decisions to control their exposure to risk according to their preferences. It is this character that differentiates farm households from consumer/ laborer households. This paper contributes to the expanding literature by adding an empirical evidence that livestock play an important role in risk control. The analysis is based on three-year data of agricultural households from the Punjab Province of Pakistan. The study area is well irrigated and famous for the rapid adoption of high-yielding varieties of wheat in the late 1960s and the early 1970s. Nevertheless, yield risk on individual farms is not negligible. Price risk also affects agricultural households since most of them market their products through private channels. During the 1980s, Pakistan witnessed a shift toward livestock products in the composition of value added in agriculture. This paper suggests that the shift within a farm had improved household welfare through a reduction in income variability. In the following, Section II describes the agricultural system in the study area and characterizes sample households, focusing on the importance of livestock animals in a household economy. Section III decomposes per capita household income into enterprise sources and then decomposes each source into deterministic and transient portions. The dec mposition quantitatively shows that livestock enable households to decrease their exposure to risk through diversification and asset decumulation. Section IV, after testing a hypothesis of full risk sharing, analyzes welfare implications of the empirical findings. Section V is a summary with some policy implications.},

abstract = {In Botswana a large cheetah population, with higher densities outside than inside protected areas, increases the potential of conflict with farmers because of livestock depredation. However, information on the extent of livestock depredation by cheetah and farmers' perceptions of this has been lacking. We interviewed 123 farmers in Ghanzi District, Botswana, to assess problems caused by cheetah depredation of livestock and farmers' attitudes towards cheetah conservation beyond protected areas. Despite livestock losses, farmers generally supported efforts to conserve cheetah, with support increasing with level of education. However, farmers felt that cheetah should not be conserved within farming areas. Land-use practice and culture related to land use played a major role in determining the level of farmers' support for cheetah conservation beyond protected areas: high on private farms, moderate in wildlife management areas, and low on communal lands. Underreporting by farmers led to underestimation by the Department of Wildlife and National Parks of the extent and nature of cheetah conflict with farmers. This study suggests that education and active involvement of farmers in planning and decision-making concerning cheetah management would enhance farmers' positive perception of cheetah conservation beyond protected areas.

abstract = {In this paper, we examine how patterns of scientific collaboration contribute to knowledge creation and diffusion. Recent studies have shown that scientists can benefit from their position within collaborative networks by being able to receive more information of better quality in a timely fashion, and by presiding over communication between collaborators. Here we focus on the tendency of scientists to cluster into tightly knit communities, and discuss the implications of this tendency for scientific production. We begin by reviewing a new method for finding communities, and we then assess its benefits in terms of computation time and accuracy. While communities often serve as a taxonomic scheme to map knowledge domains, they also affect the way scientists engage in the creation of new knowledge. By drawing on the longstanding debate on the relative benefits of social cohesion and brokerage, we discuss the conditions that facilitate collaborations among scientists within or across communities. We show that highly cited scientific production occurs within communities, when scientists have cohesive collaborations with others from the same knowledge domain, and across communities, when scientists intermediate among otherwise disconnected collaborators from different knowledge domains. We also discuss the implications of communities for information diffusion, and show how traditional epidemiological approaches need to be refined to take knowledge heterogeneity into account and preserve the system's ability to promote creative processes of novel recombinations of ideas. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Kernel methods for estimating home range are being used increasingly in wildlife research, but the effect of sample size on their accuracy is not known. We used computer simulations of 10-200 points/home range and compared accuracy of home range estimates produced by fixed and adaptive kernels with the reference (REF) and least-squares cross-validation (LSCV) methods for determining the amount of smoothing. Simulated home ranges varied from simple to complex shapes created by mixing bivariate normal distributions. We used the size of the 95{\%} home range area and the relative mean squared error of the surface fit to assess the accuracy of the kernel home range estimates. For both measures, the bias and variance approached an asymptote at about 50 observations/home range. The fixed kernel with smoothing selected by LSCV provided the least-biased estimates of the 95{\%} home range area. All kernel methods produced similar surface fit for most simulations, but the fixed kernel with LSCV had the lowest frequency and magnitude of very poor estimates. We reviewed 101 papers published in The Journal of Wildlife Management (JWM) between 1980 and 1997 that estimated animal home ranges. A minority of these papers used nonparametric utilization distribution (UD) estimators, and most did not adequately report sample sizes. We recommend that home range studies using kernel estimates use LSCV to determine the amount of smoothing, obtain a minimum of 30 observations per animal (but preferably ≥50), and report sample sizes in published results.},

abstract = {The success of a pack of Lycaon pictus hunting Thomson's gazelles Gazella thomsoni and blue wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, was influenced by age of the prey and the number of dogs hunting together, but not by amount of cover available, size of prey groups, or the distance at which prey groups fled. Wild dogs may benefit from communal hunting by increasing the range of prey species available to the pack. Although single dogs regularly killed both immature and adult Thomson's gazelles, they were not observed to kill wildebeest calves, and groups of two did not hunt adult wildebeest successfully. Hunting in groups also reduced interspecific competition from spotted hyaenas Crocuta crocuta through improved defence of carcasses.},

abstract = {The prey preferences of African lions (Panthera leo) in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, were examined in three ways. First, lion encounter rates with prey types were measured and compared with a random sample of the prey population. Lions encountered more wart hogs (Phacochoerus aethiopicus), Grant's gazelles (Gazella granti), wildebeests (ConnochaeUs taurinus), and zebras (Equus burchelli) than expected. Second, preferred prey types of lions were identified using conditional logit analysis. Lions preferred to hunt small prey groups, groups that were closer than 200 m, and groups that contained wart hogs, wildebeests, or zebras. Third, a risk-minimization optimal foraging model and a rate-maximization model were used to predict lion preferences. The foraging theory models predict that preferences should change with season and with lion group size. Qualitative support was found for most of these predictions.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

We present these key factors in amodel illustrating the levels of impact on large African carnivore conservation. 4. We identify the key principle that underpins each factor and its implications for both large carnivore conservation and human–carnivore conflict. 5. We provide a synthesis of the key factors and related principles in large African carnivore conservation and highlight the importance of the site-specific and species-specific context in conservation policy and implementation, formulated through an interdisciplinary and adaptive approach.},

Flooding-based approaches like diffusion have a strong similarity with epidemic spreading of diseases. Applying epidemiological models to information diffusion allows the evaluation of such strategies depending on the MANET characteristics, e.g. the node density. In order to choose appropriate strategies at run time, the model should be easily evaluated.In this paper, an epidemic model is developed for a simple information diffusion algorithm based on simulation results. We analytically investigate the impact of node density on information diffusion. The analytical model allows the evaluation at runtime, even on devices with restricted resources, and thus enables mobile nodes to dynamically adapt their diffusion strategies depending on the local node density.},

abstract = {Though the conservation community has long premised its moral foundations on consequentialist thinking, and has embraced a dualistic worldview severing reason from emotion, the conservation community has erred by failing to address – or even acknowledge – the limitations of these fundamental tenets. This failure reemerged in 2015 when a wealthy hunter killed an African Lion named Cecil for a trophy, in turn prompting a debate within the conservation community about the appropriateness of killing Cecil. A number of conservationists 1) defended such instances of trophy hunting on the basis that money generated by trophy hunting can support conservation, and 2) ridiculed as irrational those who oppose such instances of killing in the name of conservation. We suggest this response by the conservation community represents common, but problematic, ethical reasoning. We offer a critique of both the ethical underpinning of such reasoning and the assumptions about the relationship between reason and emotion. We urge ethical and social psychological maturation on behalf of the conservation community.},

abstract = {Intake rates and foraging efficiency depend on the anatomic features of the foraging animal and its foraging behaviour. Foraging parameters of Burchell's zebra (Equus burchelli) and Impala (Aepyceros melampus) were collected to determine the intake rate, cropping rate and bite size through observation and bite count methods. Intake rates were 48.76 +/- 0.49 g/min and 27.28 +/- 0.22 g/min for the zebra and impala, respectively. Bite size and cropping rate for zebra were 1.93 +/- 0.04 and 25.92 +/- 0.30, respectively. For impala, they were 0.78 +/- 0.01 and 35.20 +/- 0.16, respectively. The maximum theoretical intake rate for zebra was 100.96 g/min and 77.32 g/min for impala. The foraging efficiency index was higher for impala (1.03) than zebra (0.61). For zebra to achieve a 63{\%} intake satiation, forage biomass with a bite size of 1.65 g/bite was necessary, while for impala, biomass with a bite size of 0.97 g/bite was necessary. Zebra's large intake rates, bite sizes and low foraging efficiency are possibly due to its bulk and unselective foraging. Impala's high foraging efficiency, cropping rate and relatively low intake rate are associated with its relatively selective foraging strategy.},

abstract = {A predator's per capita feeding rate on prey, or its functional response, provides a foundation for predator–prey theory. Since 1959, Holling's prey-dependent Type II functional response, a model that is a function of prey abundance only, has served as the basis for a large literature on predator–prey theory.We present statistical evidence from 19 predator–prey systems that three predator-dependent functional responses (Beddington- DeAngelis, Crowley-Martin, and Hassell-Varley), i.e., models that are functions of both prey and predator abundance because of predator interference, can provide better descrip- tions of predator feeding over a range of predator–prey abundances. No single functional response best describes all of the data sets.

abstract = {Although Africa has many threatened species and biological hot spots, there are few citizen science schemes, particularly in rural communities, and there has been limited evaluation of existing programs. We engaged traditional Maasai warriors (pastoralist men aged 15 to 35) in community-based conservation and demographic monitoring of a persecuted African lion (Panthera leo) population. Through direct engagement, we investigated whether a citizen science approach employing local warriors, who had no formal education, could produce reliable data on the demographics, predation, and movements of a species with which their communities have been in conflict for generations. Warriors were given benefits such as literacy training and skill enhancement and engaged in the monitoring of the lions. The trained warriors reported on lion sign across an area nearly 4000 km(2) . Scientists worked together with the warriors to verify their reports and gather observations on the lion population. Using the verified reports and collected observations, we examined our scientific knowledge relative to the lion population preceding and during the citizen science program. Our observations showed that data quality and quantity improved with the involvement and training of the participants. Furthermore, because they engaged in conservation and gained personal benefits, the participants came to appreciate a species that was traditionally their foe. We believe engaging other local communities in biodiversity conservation and monitoring may be an effective conservation approach in rural Africa.},

Primary research, literature review, and secondary data were included in the analysis. Wolves were historically persecuted by Euro-American settler, but they have been the focus of a significant attitudinal transformation during the latter half of this century. Many now view the wolf in positive and protective ways. Considerable variation remains, however, in contemporary attitudes. Attitudes toward mountain lions have been highly ambivalent, never assuming the prominence or clarity of views on wolves. The behavior and physiology of the species, along with human psychological factors, are important reasons for the difference in human perceptions of wolves and mountain lions. We also examined attitudes toward grizzly bears. Many indigenous cultures revered grizzly bears, although European settlers were interested in exploiting and eliminating them. Today, perceptions of grizzly bears range from positive to negative. Our recommendations include targeting key groups with education programs, building support through the use of spokespeople within the target groups, integrating human and ecological concerns, and designing species-specific education initiatives in some cases.},

abstract = {The 1995/1996 reintroduction of gray wolves (Canis lupus) into Yellowstone National Park after a 70. year absence has allowed for studies of tri-trophic cascades involving wolves, elk (Cervus elaphus), and plant species such as aspen (Populus tremuloides), cottonwoods (Populus spp.), and willows (Salix spp.). To investigate the status of this cascade, in September of 2010 we repeated an earlier survey of aspen and measured browsing and heights of young aspen in 97 stands along four streams in the Lamar River catchment of the park's northern winter range. We found that browsing on the five tallest young aspen in each stand decreased from 100{\%} of all measured leaders in 1998 to means of {\textless}25{\%} in the uplands and {\textless}20{\%} in riparian areas by 2010. Correspondingly, aspen recruitment (i.e., growth of seedlings/sprouts above the browse level of ungulates) increased as browsing decreased over time in these same stands. We repeated earlier inventories of cottonwoods and found that recruitment had also increased in recent years. We also synthesized studies on trophic cascades published during the first 15. years after wolf reintroduction. Synthesis results generally indicate that the reintroduction of wolves restored a trophic cascade with woody browse species growing taller and canopy cover increasing in some, but not all places. After wolf reintroduction, elk populations decreased, but both beaver (Caster canadensis) and bison (Bison bison) numbers increased, possibly due to the increase in available woody plants and herbaceous forage resulting from less competition with elk. Trophic cascades research during the first 15. years after wolf reintroduction indicated substantial initial effects on both plants and animals, but northern Yellowstone still appears to be in the early stages of ecosystem recovery. In ecosystems where wolves have been displaced or locally extirpated, their reintroduction may represent a particularly effective approach for passive restoration. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {1. The functional response, i.e. the quantity of food consumed per unit of time as a function of food availability, is a central process in foraging ecology. The application of this concept to foraging by mammalian herbivores has led to major insights into the process of resource acquisition, but it has so far been little used to understand foraging in avian herbivores. 2. In this study, we describe the functional responses of three grazing Anatidae, the wigeon Anas penelope L. (mean body mass in this study 620 g), the barnacle goose Branta leucopsis B. (2000 g), and the greylag goose Anser anser L. (3500 g). We measured instantaneous intake rates on eight grass heights from 1 cm to 12 cm, as well as pecking rates and peck sizes, and used the Spalinger–Hobbs model developed for mammalian herbivores to explore the mechanisms limiting intake in these three species. 3. Greylag geese increased their intake rate with increasing food availability (a Type II response), wigeon showed a weak quadratic (Type IV) response, and intake rate by bar- nacle geese did not vary significantly across the range of variability we offered the birds. 4. Intake rates differed markedly between individuals, especially in greylag geese, where body mass explained much of the variation. For individuals in all three species, peck sizes strongly influenced instantaneous intake rates, and the size of the bill (width in particular) appeared to be an important determinant of peck size. 5. Peck sizes increased with sward height (although only very weakly in wigeon), but so did cropping time for wigeon and barnacle geese, which led to a significant decline of intake rates on the tallest grass, at least in the small wigeon. For these very selective small herbivores, the time to crop a mouthful was therefore a significant limiting factor for the birds' instantaneous intake rate (in addition to peck size and swallowing time). This differs markedly from the situation in mammalian herbivores where bite size (through chewing time) is the principal controlling process in food concentrated patches, a result that we found in greylag geese. We discuss the differences in foraging between the three species in relation to their principal food resources, body mass and bill morphology.},

abstract = {Villages in Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park, central Bhutan, report livestock depredation by wild carnivores including leopard (Panthera pardus), tiger (Panthera tigris), Himalayan black bear (Ursus thibettanus), and dhole (Cuon alpinus). In a survey of 274 households in six different geogs (sub-districts) within the park, 21.2{\%} of households surveyed reported losses of a total of 2.3{\%} of their domestic animals to wild predators over 12 months. This loss equated to an average annual financial loss equal to 17{\%} (US{\$} 44.72) of their total per-capita cash income. Total reported losses during 2000 amounted to US{\$} 12,252, of which leopard and tiger kills accounted for 82{\%} (US{\$} 10,047). Annual mean livestock loss per household (of those that reported loss) was 1.29 head of stock, equating to more than two-thirds of their annual cash income of {\$}250. Lax herding, inadequate guarding practices, and overgrazing may have contributed to livestock losses. Approximately 60{\%} of the households lacked proper stables for corralling their livestock at night and there was a significant correlation between the number of livestock lost and the distance between the household and the grazing pasture. Overall, reported predation rates have increased since the inception of the park in 1993 and since implementation of the Forest and Nature Conservation Act in 1995, which prioritises some of Bhutan's key livestock predators for conservation. We propose livestock intensification programmes, including pasture improvement, and financial compensation as short-term measures to reduce conflict between people and predators. In the long-term, we recommend that the feasibility of an insurance scheme should be tested, the possibility of relaxing the resource use restrictions in the Forest and Nature Conservation Act of 1995 be explored, and that farmers should be involved in managing human-wildlife conflicts - particularly through improving their own herding and guarding practices, and building proper corralling facilities and adopting reliable corralling procedures. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In South Africa, a plan was launched to manage separate sub-populations of endangered African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) in several small, geographically isolated, conservation areas as a single meta-population. This intensive management approach involves the re-introduction of wild dogs into suitable conservation areas and periodic translocations among them. To assess the attitudes towards re-introduced wild dogs, we conducted a questionnaire survey of multiple stakeholders-local community members, private landowners and tourists-in and around Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (HiP), one of the meta-population conservation areas. Here, we document conflicting human interests over the re-introduced wild dogs. Tourists in HiP, on the one hand, expressed overwhelmingly positive opinions about wild dogs across personal details of the respondents, but especially after having seen free-ranging wild dogs. On the other hand, we found misconceptions and perceptions that were more negative among the rural population around HiP, again largely independent of personal details of the participants, although educated respondents voiced more favourable views of wild dogs. These negative attitudes were in particular due to perceived and real threats of livestock losses. In a follow-up questionnaire survey, we also discovered apparent shortcomings of a previous short-lived conservation education programme among the local communities adjacent to HiP. Consequently, the mitigation of the conflict between wild dogs and rural people requires an understanding of the conditions under which livestock predation occurs, the encouragement of practices that prevent such predation, and increasing local tolerance of co-existence with wild dogs through both economic and non-monetary incentive schemes as well as continued conservation education. ¬{\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Social learning has been documented in a wide diversity of animals. In free-living animals, however, it has been difficult to discern whether animals learn socially by observing other group members or asocially by acquiring a new behaviour independently. We addressed this challenge by developing network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA), which analyses the spread of traits through animal groups and takes into account that social network structure directs social learning opportunities. NBDA fits agent-based models of social and asocial learning to the observed data using maximum-likelihood estimation. The underlying learning mechanism can then be identified using model selection based on the Akaike information criterion. We tested our method with artificially created learning data that are based on a real-world co-feeding network of macaques. NBDA is better able to discriminate between social and asocial learning in comparison with diffusion curve analysis, the main method that was previously applied in this context. NBDA thus offers a new, more reliable statistical test of learning mechanisms. In addition, it can be used to address a wide range of questions related to social learning, such as identifying behavioural strategies used by animals when deciding whom to copy.},

The present research provides a cumulative and theoretical approach to the measurement of EA, in which the multidimensional and hierarchical nature of EA is considered. Reported are findings from three studies on the development of a psychometrically sound, multidimensional inventory to assess EA cross-culturally, the Environmental Attitudes Inventory (EAI). The EAI has twelve specific scales that capture the main facets measured by previous research. The twelve factors were established through confirmatory factor analyses, and the EAI scales are shown to be unidimensional scales with high internal consistency, homogeneity and high test-retest reliability, and also to be largely free from social desirability. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

As part of the interdisciplinary exchange between the natural and social sciences, this review contrasts structured questionnaire-based surveys with qualitative approaches to collecting social data, and clarifies contexts in which particular qualitative methods might be more effective when investigating human behaviour in conservation research. Although well-designed questionnaire-based surveys may be useful for population-level generalizations, complementary use of qualitative approaches can significantly enhance understanding of research context, underpinning formulation of representative sampling frames and pertinent research questions, and permitting greater accuracy in interpretation and analysis of data. Good qualitative data are necessary to an accurate understanding of categories, processes, relationships and perceptions, particularly critical in a cross-cultural context, significantly strengthening the internal validity of subsequent structured work. Furthermore, stand-alone qualitative research can also constitute a valuable and valid approach to matters critical to conservation research and to designing successful conservation initiatives, which cannot be effectively researched in any other way.},

abstract = {Managing natural resources often depends on influencing people's behaviour, however effectively targeting
interventions to discourage environmentally harmful behaviours is challenging because those involved may
be unwilling to identify themselves. Non-sensitive indicators of sensitive behaviours are therefore needed.
Previous studies have investigated people's attitudes, assuming attitudes reflect behaviour. There has also
been interest in using people's estimates of the proportion of their peers involved in sensitive behaviours to
identify those involved, since people tend to assume that others behave like themselves. However, there has been little attempt to test the potential of such indicators. We use the randomized response technique (RRT), designed for investigating sensitive behaviours, to estimate the proportion of farmers in north-eastern South Africa killing carnivores, and use a modified logistic regression model to explore relationships between our best estimates of true behaviour (from RRT) and our proposed non-sensitive indicators (including farmers' attitudes, and estimates of peer-behaviour). Farmers' attitudes towards carnivores, question sensitivity and estimates of peers' behaviour, predict the likelihood of farmers killing carnivores. Attitude and estimates of peer-behaviour are useful indicators of involvement in illicit behaviours and may be used to identify groups of people to engage in interventions aimed at changing behaviour.},

abstract = {Human–wildlife conflict is often viewed as a local problem involving the misbehaviour of people or animals (e.g. elephants transgress park bound-aries to raid neighbouring crops, or farmers plant crops in wildlife habitat). Framing the issue this way tends to promote technical solutions like fencing and buffer crops; useful but often inadequate measures for promoting the long-term coexistence of people and wildlife (Breitenmoser et al., Chapter 4; Osborn and Hill, Chapter 5). Geographers, anthropologists and other social scientists can illuminate the deeper causes of conflict and help guide long-term management solutions in several ways. First, social scientists can reveal the driving forces of land use change that impel people to plant crops or raise livestock in high-risk areas. Additionally, they can also assess the severity of the conflict by documenting the spatial and social distribution of wildlife damage, and the varying capacity of individuals to cope with such losses. Finally and more broadly, they can illuminate the social factors that intensify human–wildlife conflict or favour coexistence (Knight 2001). In this chapter, we analyse the socio-ecological factors that shape rural African citizens' tolerance of crop loss to wildlife, particularly elephants (Loxodonta africana). (Elephants are the focus of much human–wildlife conflict research in Africa. They deserve special consideration as an Appendix I CITES species and a tourist, 'flagship' species. We first survey 26 reports from 15 African countries to identify factors that intensify human–wildlife conflict, and to compare losses between elephants and other 'pests' at different scales. We also draw from the general literature on pests and risk in African peasant agriculture to better understand why some communities may be unable or unwilling to tolerate crop losses to wildlife. We then test the predicted patterns of vulnerability in the area Uganda, where farmers risk crop loss to a variety of wildlife, including primates, bush pigs (Potamochoerus spp.) and elephants. Our case study and review indicate that elephants and other large mammals generally cause far less damage to regional agricultural produc-tion than do rodents and invertebrate pests. However, aggregate measures of damage may be misleading. People's perception of risk is as important as actually losses, and their perceptions more often focus on rare, extreme damage events (e.g. a catastrophic raid by elephants) than persistent, small losses that cumulatively may be greater. Moreover, large ungulates and large carnivores are often viewed as highly charged symbols of state intervention and coercion; thus the damage they cause is especially resented (Newmark et al. 1994; Naughton-Treves 1997; De Boer and Baquete 1998; Nchanji and Lawson 1998; Gillingham and Lee 1999). The Kibale case study also reveals that when risk is absorbed at the individual household level, material wealth, and in particularly landholding size, determine who is able to cope with major losses to wildlife.},

When all unreliable figures were discarded, the maximum growth rate for C3 stands fell in the range 34–39 g m−2 d−1 compared with 50–54 g m−2 d−1 for C4 stands. Maximum growth rates averaged over the whole growing season showed a similar difference: 13 g m−2 d−1 for C3 and 22 g m−2 d−1 for C4.

This is explored in the context of (1) changing tolerance for wildlife activity on farms, (2) the implications of past conserva-tion policy and practice for farmers' understanding of " ownership " of wild-life, and (3) how such issues influence farmers' expectations of who is responsible for protecting crops from wildlife.},

However, this conclusion largely depends upon what is meant by stewardship and what actions are required for wolves to be conserved.

@article{Whittemore1973,
abstract = {A generalized framework for developing analytical and conceptual relationships involving the flow of information has previously been suggested. This paper provides further refinement, rigor, and extension for some of the earlier relationships suggested. In particular, a measure of the amount of information is defined as the difference of the value of the decision state of the decision-maker after and before receipt of the message. This measure is universally applicable for all information that is concerned with the effectiveness of the message upon the recipient. It is accordingly called pragmatic information. The definition is a direct consequence of the interdependence between information and decision-making and of the definition that information is data of value in decision-making. In order to evaluate this measure of information, it is convenient to use a generalized information system model which has previously been proposed and which has virtually universal applicability. The use of this model permits the evaluation of the measure of information in terms of the reduction of uncertainty to o decision maker. Six different types of uncertainty are identified. Specifically, a type of uncertainty which is generally overlooked in the decision-making literature is found to be important. This is called executional uncertainty. It is pointed out that the information science aspects of decision theory must cover comprehensively those decision-makers who not only are expert but those decision-makers who may be mediocre or even rather poor. Although any decision rule may be utilized in terms of the framework outlined, a suggested rule which is convenient and reasonable is proposed for evaluating the decision state of a decision-maker of any point in time. The measure of information suggested is situation, time, and decision-maker dependent. The framework and relationships developed ore on important step toward the development of a true theory of information science. It is further suggested that each data set or document might have some average (over time) amount of information content for o decision-maker of any given ‘effectiveness'. The relationship of this average amount of information as a function of the decision-maker effectiveness is suggested as an important functional relationship that exists for every document. It is called an information profile of that document or data set. A typical information profile is suggested. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Few species are likely to be so evident that they will always be detected when present. Failing to allow for the possibility that a target species was present, but undetected, at a site will lead to biased estimates of site occupancy, colonization, and local extinction probabilities. These population vital rates are often of interest in long-term monitoring programs and metapopulation studies. We present a model that enables direct estimation of these parameters when the probability of detecting the species is less than 1. The model does not require any assumptions of process stationarity, as do some previous methods, but does require detection/nondetection data to be collected in a manner similar to Pollock's robust design as used in mark–recapture studies. Via simulation, we show that the model provides good estimates of parameters for most scenarios considered. We illustrate the method with data from monitoring programs of Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) in northern California and ti...},

Residence adjacent to fresh water, the presence of outdoor pets, higher risk belief scores, higher nuisance belief scores, higher education, and older age were all related to complaining about an alligator, whereas general attitude toward alligators was not. Results are consistent with the “specificity principle” for attitude–behavior correspondence and emphasize the impor- tance of situational factors as behavioral determinants. Targeted harvest areas can help to manage complaints in marginal habitats where risk from alligators is persistent.

(2) The maximum food intakes of rabbits, kangaroos and sheep during the trial were 68, 62 and 61 g kg-0.75 day-1, respectively. These intakes are similar despite the 30{\%} difference in basal metabolic rates between eutherians and marsupials. (3) All species avoided Maireana but when food was scarce sheep switched to it more strongly than did the other herbivore species. Sheep consumed 20{\%} of their intake as Maireana at a pasture biomass of 250 kg ha-1 compared to only 10{\%} by the other two species at this biomass. Maireana reached 20{\%} of the intake of rabbits and kangaroos at a pasture biomass of 100 kg ha-1. (4) Harvesting efficiencies (i.e. the ability to maintain food intake at low vegetation biomasses) of kangaroos, sheep and rabbits were considerably higher than that of sheep grazing sown pastures in higher rainfall areas. (5) The three herbivore species appeared equally capable of reducing the pasture to an ungrazable residuum of less than 20 kg ha-1. (6) The relationship between food intake and food availability for each species of herbivore was an asymptotic function, suggesting that this, rather than a linear function, is the typical pattern for most mammalian herbivores.},

abstract = {Minimizing the inherent conflict between protecting fauna and flora and accommodating the needs of the local communities is one of the greatest challenges facing protected area (PA) management in developing countries of the world. Allowing pastoralists access to PAs and their resources remains a contentious issue in southern Kenya, where retaliatory killing of African lions (Panthera leo) by Maasai pastoralists has caused a steep decline in the lion population, threatening local extinction.Previous studies that have shown that local people often have negative attitudes toward PAs; here PA policy during times of hardship is linked to attitudes toward lions and behavioural intentions. Different access policies to grazing inside Tsavo andNairobi National Parks during the 2008/2009 drought influenced Maasai attitudes toward lions and their propensity to kill them. A semi-structured questionnaire (n=206) and a multivariate model examine the relative importance of PA access and 11 additional predictors on individuals' attitudes and reported inclination to kill lions. Access for livestock to PAs, benefits from wildlife and higher education were associated with positive attitudes toward lions and a lower reported propensity to kill. The success of lion conservation in Maasailand may depend upon recognizing and accommodating pastoralists' inherent vulnerability to drought-induced livestock mortality},

This paper reviews many of the methods and describes the relationships among them, both mathematically, using the cross-product as a unifying principle, and conceptually, based on the form of a moving window or template used in calculation. The relationships among these methods suggest that while no single method can reveal all the important characteristics of spatial data, the results of different analyses are not expected to be completely independent of each other.},

abstract = {The populations of the ecologically dominant ungulates in the Serengeti ecosystem (zebra, wildebeest and buffalo) have shown markedly different trends since the 1960s: the two ruminants both irrupted after the elimination of rinderpest in 1960, while the zebras have remained stable. The ruminants are resource limited (though parts of the buffalo population have been limited by poaching since the 1980s). The zebras' resource acquisition tactics should allow them to outcompete the ruminants, but their greater spatial dispersion makes them more available to predators, and it has been suggested that this population is limited by predation. To investigate the mechanisms involved in the population dynamics of Serengeti zebra, we compared population dynamics among the three species using demographic models based on age-class-specific survival and fecundity. The only major difference between zebra and the two ruminants occurred in the first-year survival. We show that wildebeest have a higher reproductive potential than zebra (younger age at first breeding and shorter generation time). Nevertheless, these differences in reproduction cannot account for the observed differences in the population trends between the zebra and the ruminants. On the other hand, among-species differences in first-year survival are great enough to account for the constancy of zebra population size. We conclude that the very low first-year survival of zebra limits this population. We provide new data on predation in the Serengeti and show that, as in other ecosystems, predation rates on zebras are high, so predation could hold the population in a "predator pit". However, lion and hyena feed principally on adult zebras, and further work is required to discover the process involved in the high mortality of foals.},

Human encroachment into cougar habitat may lead to increased instances of cougar-human interactions. Surveys (n = 1,508) were sent to foothills residents in the urban-rural fringe of Calgary, Alberta to determine risk perceptions and attitudes toward cougars. Risk perceptions were analyzed for seven discrete variables: gender, age, education, livestock ownership, community of residence, years at residence, and level of experience with cougars. Results showed overall positive attitudes toward the presence of cougars in the foothills. Females, communities closest to the City of Calgary, livestock owners, and individuals with high levels of experience with cougars felt most at risk from cougars. Residents indicated a low level of knowledge concerning cougars and wished to be more directly involved in wildlife decision-making. Recommended strategies to lessen the perceived risk toward cougars include increasing the awareness of cougars through targeted education and public involvement. {\textcopyright} Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Human-wildlife conflicts are common across Africa. In Mozambique, official records show that wildlife killed 265 people during 27 months (July 2006 to September 2008). Crocodile Crocodylus niloticus, lion Panthera leo, elephant Loxodonta africana and hippopotamus Hippopotamus amphibius caused most deaths but crocodiles were responsible for 66{\%}. Crocodile attacks occurred across Mozambique but 53{\%} of deaths occurred in districts bordering Lake Cabora Bassa and the Zambezi River. Hippopotamus attacks were also concentrated here. Lion attacks occurred mainly in northern Mozambique and, while people were attacked by elephants across the country, 67{\%} of deaths occurred in northern Mozambique. Attacks by lions, elephants or hippopotamuses were relatively rare but additional data will probably show that attacks by these species are more widespread than the preliminary records suggest. Buffalo Syncerus caffer, hyaena Crocuta crocuta and leopard Panthera pardus were minor conflict species. Good land-use planning, a long-term solution to many conflicts, is particularly relevant in Mozambique, where the crocodile and hippopotamus populations of protected areas are often in rivers that border these areas, and cause conflicts outside them, and where people commonly live within protected areas. Poverty may prompt fishermen to risk crocodile attack by entering rivers or lakes. The high incidence of conflicts near Limpopo and South Africas Kruger National Parks (both within the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Conservation Area) highlights the problems created for people by facilitating the unrestricted movement of wildlife between protected areas across their land.

Crop loss to wild animals undermines local support for conservation efforts in this area. Patterns of primate crop raiding were studied over a period of 14 months in six villages (five adjacent to the Budongo Forest Reserve and one that is approximately 3,500 m from the forest edge). Data were collected via a questionnaire survey. Additional information was obtained from the relevant local government offices. Chimpanzees Pan troglodytes, baboons Papio anubis, other monkeys, bush pigs Potamochoeus procus and porcupines Hystrix cristata were reported by farmers to be the major causes of crop losses by wildlife. Of farmers, 73{\%} reported suffering crop damage caused by primates, and 79{\%} considered baboons to be the most destructive of all crop raiding species. Drought, insect pests, poor sowing, plant diseases and accidental fires were other sources of crop losses to farmers, though the risk of crop damage particularly by primates is perceived as the most serious potential cause of losses. Using chimpanzees as a case study, patterns of crop damage across the year are compared with seasonal fluctuations in availability of wild foods.},

abstract = {Predation on livestock is one of the main factors that cause the felids hunting, in particular for puma and jaguar this conflict with humans is severe. Most studies have assessed the predation impacts on livestock production; however there is a spatial pattern in attacks occurrence that is feasible to analyze from ecological niche modeling. The objective of this research was to generate a risk model of livestock predation by puma and jaguar in Mexico based on environmental and livestock management variables, which allows identification of zones of risk in order to define mitigation strategies at national level. We produced a geographic ensemble model of risk of predation from three algorithms for jaguar and five for puma. The variables most positively related with predation risk by jaguar were vegetative cover percentage, percentage of free grazing animals, and altitude, whereas arid vegetation has a negative influence on predation risk. In the case of puma the variables with highest contribution were livestock density, which negatively influences on the predation risk, in addition to forest and altitude, both with a positive relation. The ensemble models are an accurate approach to delineating the zones of predation risk by felids; however at a regional scale the environmental characteristics that favor predation may be different. It is recommended that researchers carry out studies for each biogeographic province that facilitate the identification of specific patterns and the definition of mitigation strategies most suitable for each one. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {1. Through reconciling census totals with population structure, annual survival rates were estimated for the juvenile, yearling and adult stages of 10 ungulate species over 14 years or longer in South Africa's Kruger National Park. During this period four species maintained high abundance levels, while six species declined progressively in abundance. 2. Multiple regression models fitted to these estimates indicated that juvenile survival was sensitive to annual variability in rainfall for most of these species, especially in the dry season component, but with no density feedback apparent. Rainfall components affected adult survival in several of the declining species, while negative density dependence in adult survival was evident for three of the four species that maintained high abundance. A negative effect of past prey availability, indexing putative changes in predator abundance, on adult survival was more strongly supported statistically among the declining species than the lagged effect of prior rainfall, potentially affecting herbaceous vegetation cover and composition. 3. The high sensitivity of juvenile survival to environmental variability among these ungulate species was consistent with the general pattern identified for large mammalian herbivores, although the absence of any survival response counteracting the density declines was surprising. The susceptibility of adult survival to environmental influences for the declining species appeared unusual and probably reflected an interaction between nutritional shortfalls and a numerical increase in lions, preying largely upon the adult segment of these species. The ungulate species that persisted at high abundance seemed resistant to effects of rainfall on food resources and evidently drove the changes in predator abundance. The sharp density effect on adult survival among these species could indicate prey switching by lions following changes in their relative availability. 4. Findings extend past generalizations about the demographic processes underlying the population dynamics of large mammalian herbivores and reveal how the survival rates of particular population segments respond differently to environmental influences. Demographic patterns help reveal the interplay of changing resource supplies, predation pressure and population abundance on population changes.},

abstract = {Introducing a new, or previously extant, species to an ecosystem is a risky decision, and managers need quantitative methods that can predict the consequences for the recipient ecosystem. Proponents of keystone predator reintroductions commonly argue that the presence of the predator will restore ecosystem function, but this has not always been the case, and mathematical modeling has important role to play in predicting how reintroductions will likely play out. We propose an ensemble modeling method that integrates species interaction networks and dynamic community simulations, and use it to describe the range of plausible consequences of keystone predator reintroduction. Previous methods for predicting ecosystem responses to such interventions have focused on predicting changes around a given equilibrium state and have conceptual problems extrapolating to new equilibria (e.g., with the new species present). Our method predicts changing abundances through time and works equally well when the system is far from equilibrium. We illustrate this method by modeling the range of potential outcomes for the reintroduction of wolves (Canis lupus) to Yellowstone National Park, and of dingoes (Canis dingo) to a National Park in Australia, and demonstrate how the method can provide important guidance on the potential risks of reintroduction. Ensemble ecosystem modeling can also be applied to assess the ecosystem-wide implications of other types of interventions including assisted migration, biocontrol and invasive species eradication.

annote = {Lack of theories that can be applied across systems and cultures. So no consistent variables or constructs to guide the selection of variable in attitude research, which stops cross species and cross cultural comparisons.

3 indexes

Created categories of variables that affected attitudes

Application Index APP = frequency a category examined in surveys

Significance index SIG = relative frequency variables included in a category were found to significantly explain attitudes - how important a category is in explaining attitudes. 

Accuracy Index ACC = how often category variables were found to be significant in a publication relative to the frequency it was applied in a publication, measure of how accurately categories are used relative to their importance in explaining attitudes. 

RESULTS

Cost and Benefit
cost frequently applied and often significant. Intangible costs more important in explaining costs than tangible costs. 
Benefit less frequently applied, similarly intangible benefits more important than tangible in explaining attitudes.

Experience, exposure and interest in a species
Experience of species commonly applied and fairly Sig. Personal experience sub cat best predictor in experience category, distance to species less good predictor and length lived in area not a good predictor.
Species characteristics comprised of measures of perceptions of species presence/absence, abundance, density, frequency seen etc. Medium Sig.

Salience and Knowledge
Salience low sig value. Knowledge medium sig.

Mitigation

DISCUSSION
Intangible costs and benefits more important. Also costs more important than benefits, so negative perceptions stronger influence on attitudes than positive perceptions.

Socio-demographic

abstract = {Shifting prey selection has been identified as a mechanism potentially regulating predator-prey interactions, but it may also lead to different outcomes, especially in more complex systems with multiple prey species available. We assessed changing prey selection by lions, the major predator for 12 large herbivore species in South Africa's Kruger National Park. The database was provided by records of found carcasses ascribed to kills by lions assembled over 70 years, coupled with counts of changing prey abundance extending over 30 years. Wildebeest and zebra constituted the most favored prey species during the early portion of the study period, while selection for buffalo rose in the south of the park after a severe drought increased their vulnerability. Rainfall had a negative influence on the proportional representation of buffalo in lion kills, but wildebeest and zebra appeared less susceptible to being killed under conditions of low rainfall. Selection by lions for alternative prey species, including giraffe, kudu, waterbuck, and warthog, was influenced by the changing relative abundance and vulnerability of the three principal prey species. Simultaneous declines in the abundance of rarer antelope species were associated with a sharp increase in selection for these species at a time when all three principal prey species were less available. Hence shifting prey selection by lions affected the dynamics of herbivore populations in different ways: promoting contrasting responses by principal prey species to rainfall variation, while apparently being the main cause of sharp declines by alternative prey species under certain conditions. Accordingly, adaptive responses by predators, to both the changing relative abundance of the principal prey species, and other conditions affecting the relative vulnerability of various species, should be taken into account to understand the interactive dynamics of multispecies predator-prey webs.},

abstract = {/ Prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.) have been labeled as keystone species because of their influence on biological diversity and ecosystem function. However, the validity of several assumptions used to support keystone status is questionable. We review the strength of the evidence and the magnitude of the prairie dog's effects on ecosystem structure and function. We use this review to reevaluate the keystone role for prairie dogs. Our goal is to encourage sound management of the prairie dog ecosystem by improving the ecological foundation of their keystone status. Our review confirms that prairie dogs affect a number of ecosystem-level functions but that their influence on prairie vertebrates may be less than previously suggested. Species richness and abundance patterns were variable among plants, mammals, and birds and were not consistently higher on prairie dog colonies compared to uncolonized areas. In addition, only nine of the 208 species listed in the literature as observed on or near prairie dogs colonies had quantitative evidence of dependence on prairie dogs. Abundance data indicated opportunistic use of colonies for an additional 20 species. A total of 117 species may have some relationship with prairie dogs, but we lacked sufficient data to evaluate the strength of this relationship. The remaining 62 species may be accidental or alien to the system. Despite our conclusion that some prairie dog functions may be smaller than previously assumed, collectively these functions are quite large compared to other herbivores in the system. We suggest that prairie dogs also provide some unique functions not duplicated by any other species and that continued decline of prairie dogs may lead to a substantial erosion of biological diversity and landscape heterogeneity across prairie and shrub-steppe landscapes. Thus, we concur that keystone status for prairie dogs is appropriate and may aid conservation efforts that help protect species dependent on prairie dogs and support other important ecosystem functions.KEY WORDS: Prairie dogs; Cynomys spp.; Keystone species; Ecosystem functions; Biological diversityhttp://link.springer-ny.com/link/service/journals/00267/bibs/24n2p177.html},

The survey is attempting, not to be competitive with other surveys, but rather to be a source of complementary input. A variety of views should stimulate the discussion on this important topic and, hopefully, better progress will be achieved by the entire conservation community. The document is structured into three parts: Chapter one delineates purpose and used methods, chapter two describes distribution, population status, and habitat requirements of the lion across its range, and chapter three deals with driving forces for lion population trends. Human-lion conflicts, use of lions as a resource, existing lion conservation policies, and challenges to lion conservation are discussed.},

abstract = {Large carnivores face serious threats and are experiencing massive declines in their populations and geographic ranges around the world. We highlight how these threats have affected the conservation status and ecological functioning of the 31 largest mammalian carnivores on Earth. Consistent with theory, empirical studies increasingly show that large carnivores have substantial effects on the structure and function of diverse ecosystems. Significant cascading trophic interactions, mediated by their prey or sympatric mesopredators, arise when some of these carnivores are extirpated from or repatriated to ecosystems. Unexpected effects of trophic cascades on various taxa and processes include changes to bird, mammal, invertebrate, and herpetofauna abundance or richness; subsidies to scavengers; altered disease dynamics; carbon sequestration; modified stream morphology; and crop damage. Promoting tolerance and coexistence with large carnivores is a crucial societal challenge that will ultimately determine the fate of Earth's largest carnivores and all that depends upon them, including humans.},

abstract = {1. Invaded ecosystems present complex management issues. This problem is exacerbated in many situations by a lack of knowledge about the ecosystem. However, delaying conservation action to collect further data and so reduce such uncertainty is often either impractical or inadvisable. 2. The Macquarie Island Pest Eradication Project, currently underway, is attempting to eradicate rabbits, rats, and mice fromthe island.Weundertook qualitativemodelling of this project, examin- ing a range of likely outcomes and their possible ecological consequences. The results were aggre- gated across a large number of possible models, in order to account for uncertainty concerning interactions within the ecosystem. 3. The results strongly support the current actions of simultaneous eradication of all three pest species, as simulated eradications of only one or two generally led to continued impacts on the island's native biota. The results also provided support for the anticipated positive outcomes of the project, with predicted recoveries of tall tussock vegetation, and burrow- and surface-nesting seabirds. 4. However, themodel predictions also highlighted potential risks: the eradication of mice fromthe island may not succeed, due in part to the structural position of this species within the ecosystem. Successful eradication of all three target species could potentially release the self-introduced, non- native redpolls and starlings, allowing expansion of their populations, with possible impacts on macro-invertebrates and vegetation. 5. Synthesis and applications. These results demonstrate that qualitative modelling approaches can in some cases deliver consistent results, despite high levels of uncertainty regarding interactions within the underlying ecosystem. Such outcomes can provide assistance in the development of stra- tegic contingency plans and ongoing futuremanagement action.},

abstract = {1. Where wildlife is not formally protected in Africa, abundant species are often consumptively managed, for benefit, control, or both. Such management should preferably be based on some understanding of the ecological processes regulating populations, the extent to which wildlife conflicts with livestock, and the rates at which wildlife can be harvested on a sustainable basis. 2. We report the results of a simulation modelling analysis of the dynamics of a plains zebra population in Laikipia District, Kenya. This largely unfenced, non-protected area of 9666 km(2) is comprised of privately, publicly, and communally owned properties supporting livestock and wildlife. We examined the influence of rainfall on zebra abundance, and evaluated the sustainability of alternative harvesting regimes. 3. The model was stage- and sex-structured, corresponding with age/sex classes recognizable in the field. Vital rates and age at first reproduction were adjusted annually using two alternative approaches, both involving annual re-calculation of carrying capacity as a function of rainfall. The first adjustment factor was simply a function of carrying capacity - a solely 'Rainfall-Dependent' (RD) mechanism. The second adjustment factor was proportional to the ratio of carrying capacity to population size - a Rainfall-Mediated Density-Dependent (RMDD) mechanism. 4. Both versions of the model reconstructed known zebra dynamics over the last 16 years within the precision afforded by sample counting. However, RMDD gave a better fit, yielded parameter settings that were meaningful ecologically, and better predicted the impact of a severe drought than did RD. We infer that rainfall strongly influences the abundance of Laikipia's zebras by a mechanism involving adjustments in the strength of density dependence. 5. Simulations using RMDD suggested that previously allocated annual harvest quotas in Laikipia (up to 15{\%}) might not have been sustainable, but a 6{\%} annual harvest would be a sustainable harvest. 6. Synthesis and applications: The model captures a fundamental feature of the mechanism by which rainfall limits large-bodied savanna ungulates: populations typically decline faster during dry phases than they can increase during wet phases. As a result, the greater the variation in annual rainfall, the greater the proportion of time the population spends below carrying capacity. The model has been adopted as the basis for zebra management in Laikipia. To our knowledge, this is the first population-specific model to be used to guide the consumptive management of a wild ungulate in Kenya.},

However, such interference can also occur between conspecific predators. 2. Therefore, to understand the importance of predator biodiversity and the degree that predator species can be considered functionally interchangeable, we determined the degree of additivity and redundancy of predators in multiple- and single-species combinations. 3. We show that interference between two invasive species of predatory crabs, Carcinus maenas and Hemigrapsus sanguineus , reduced the risk of predation for shared amphipod prey, and had redundant per capita effects in most multiple- and single-species predator combinations. 4. However, when predator combinations with the potential for intraguild predation were examined, predator interference increased and predator redundancy decreased. 5. Our study indicates that trophic structure is important in determining how the effects of predator species combine and demonstrates the utility of determining the redundancy, as well as the additivity, of multiple predator species.},

abstract = {Ecotourism has a potentially vital role to play in conservation by generating economic incentives for nature conservation. However, some authors contend that this potential may be limited by narrow viewing preferences among visitors to protected areas, suggesting that most tourists are primarily interested in seeing charismatic mega- fauna largely confined to government or privately-owned parks. We assessed viewing preferences among tourists at four protected areas in South Africa to test the validity of this contention. Mega-herbivores and large carnivores were the most popular species, particularly among first-time and overseas visitors, but African visi- tors and experienced wildlife viewers were more interested in bird and plant diver- sity, scenery, and rarer, less easily-observed and/or less high-profile mammals. Several of these favored species are extinction prone and often absent from wildlife areas due to sensitivity to human encroachment and competition with more abundant species. Hence, ecotourism may provide incentives for the conservation of intact guilds, and management for ecotourism may align more closely with biodiversity conservation objectives than suggested by critics. This potential could be enhanced by diversification of tour operator advertising to feature aspects of biodiversity other than the ‘big five'. Nonetheless, charismatic mega-fauna have a vital flagship role by attracting most overseas and first-time visitors to protected areas.},

In economic loss, kills represented 0.3{\%} of the cattle stock value. Depredation was mainly associated with cattle's age class and location along with the time of birth of calves. The proportion of pastures next to forest with depredation (n = 33, 48.5{\%}) was not distinguished to the proportion of pastures not bordering forest with depredation (n = 35, 51.5{\%}). However, the proportion of pastures next to forest with depredation represented 54{\%} (n = 33) of the 61 total pastures that were at least partially surrounded by forest patches or riparian forests that comprised eight continuum blocks of forest fragments of different sizes in the ranch and adjacent areas. No kills occurred in the central portion (main house) of the farm, close to the headquarters where the pastures not bordering forest. The distances of the kills in relation to areas of native forest was 1317.48 ?? 941.03 m.

The authors presented their coexistence model as an alternative to the widely held principle that long-term tiger conservation requires extensive areas where human-use is excluded. We believe that this study makes a fundamental logic error by conflating "co-occurrence" with "coexistence." Their data demonstrate spatial co-occurrence conditioned on temporal separation, an unsurprising finding. Coexistence, the relevant interspecific dynamic process, has not been demonstrated and requires long-term data they did not collect. The conclusion of human-tiger coexistence is based on three main research findings. First, similar tiger densities occur "inside" and "outside" Chitwan National Park. Second, the occurrence of tigers at camera locations is unrelated to human use. Third, the co-occurrence of tigers and humans at camera locations are temporally separated.},
